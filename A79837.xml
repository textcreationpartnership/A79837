            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a queſtion much controverted in theſe times, whether Jeſus Chriſt, beſides his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom in his Chrurches, and in the hearts of his people, is to have an outward Political Kingdom in the world? and there are not a few of godly, wiſe, and ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that do conclude affirmatively for the ſame, and that (as it ſeems to me) upon undeniable authorities from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. But this being granted, it will prove a matter of no leſſe difficulty to determine by whom this kingdome ſhall be adminiſtred, whether by our Lord Jeſus himſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſiding here upon earth; or by his Delegates, or officers to whom he ſhall commit the rule and government under himſelf? The former hath yet received ſmall entertainment in my heart, as ſeeing little clear Scripture evidence for it (whatever others may ſee) but rather it ſeeming to claſh with ſome other weighty doctrines of the faith more clearly grounded on the Word, and to be attended with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
<pb facs="tcp:164143:3"/> as the Authours of this opinion know not well how to remove: But for the latter, it need not ſeem ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible; for ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt hath already ſo long exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſpiritual Kingdome, and regiment in his Churches, by Officers and Delegates thereunto appointed by himſelf; why ſhould it then ſeem ſtrange to us, if his outward political Kingdome ſhould be adminiſtred in like manner? and (as I judge) this ſeemes to have far clearer teſtimony from the Scripture then the former. But are not we in a great ſtrait yet to finde out, who are theſe Officers or Delegates to whom Jeſus Chriſt hath committed the government of this outward Political Kingdome in the world? whether to his Churches and Saints (under that reduplication) as ſuch, or to the Civil Magiſtrate? I am not unwilling to acknowledge my own miſtake, (and poſſibly it may be the miſtake of ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hearts, who are zealous now againſt the preſent powers upon this account) that I have ſometimes inclined to the former, although I never had thoughts of acting againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſtabliſhed Government, for to bring about my concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſuch things, ſure it is moſt dangerous and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for private perſons to do ſo; The ground of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake was an aſſertion received amongſt many wiſe and holy men, and therefore the leſſe queſtioned by me; that the Magiſtrate was no Officer of Jeſus Chriſt as Mediatour; whereupon I concluded, ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ſhould have an outward Political Kingdom upon earth, and the Magiſtrate as ſuch, was no Officer in that Kingdome, that there muſt be ſome other hands, into which this power and Dominion muſt be committed, and who then might lay better Scripture claim to it, then the perſons above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</p>
            <p>But I do retract my errour in that particular (for I dare not ſay with the Papiſts and Quakers, I am infallible and cannot erre,) and do acknowledge the Magiſtrate to be an Officer of Jeſus Chriſt as Mediatour, and therefore in this external Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb facs="tcp:164143:3"/> Kingdom of Chriſt, the rule doth belong to him, and not to the Saints as Saints; though withal I doubt not but the Lord Jeſus will in theſe laſt dayes raiſe up ſuch to be Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as ſhall be Saints and nurſing fathers to his Churches, governing more for the honour of Chriſt, and for the welfare and benefit of his Churches then formerly, and then ſhall the kingdoms of the world become the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Saints.</p>
            <p>That which induced me to be of this judgement for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to be an Officer of Jeſus Chriſt in this outward Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical kingdom (though he is no Officer in the ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Church, as the Eraſtians contend) was the ſerious conſideration of ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18 <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.13. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2.8, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 72.10, 11. and indeed Chriſt having undertaken the work of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, the Father hath delivered up the whole creation unto him in order to his managing of that work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt Magiſtracy belong to him as Mediatour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22. <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. It were a work of no great difficulty to anſwer the arguments brought to the contrary, and is already done by ſome.</p>
            <p>Now this being granted, as it doth ſtrongly confirme the title of the Magiſtrate to his rule and government, againſt all that would, under any pretext, challenge it from him: So it may ſeriouſly minde him to conſider from whom he hath received his power and authority, and to whom he muſt one day be acountable for it, and therefore to uſe it (not only for the promoting of the civil good and benefit of men, but) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the advantage of the ſpiritual Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and the intereſt of his Churches; for it was in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that Chriſt had this power given to him by the Father, he gave him to be head over all things to the Church; and ſure Chriſt expects that thoſe to whom he commits this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as his Vice-gerents upon earth, ſhould uſe it for the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:164143:4"/> ends, the Father did firſt betruſt it into his hands for. And how clear is it in Scripture, that all thoſe godly Princes and Magiſtrates ſpoken of therein, did make it their firſt and chiefeſt care to promote Religion, and to ſee that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God was maintained in purity, and that the Church flouriſhed in their Dominions; not that they were Officers in the Church, and might themſelves adminiſter in the holy things, this was rebuked in ſome of them; but that they had an external care about the ſame, as ſometimes that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> of famous memory ſaid, he was <hi>Epiſcopus</hi>

               </gap> (<hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 4.) an overſeer of things without, as thoſe nurſe-fathers, <hi>Hezekiah, Joſia, Aſa, Jehoſhaphat</hi> were; but not an overſeer of things within, as <hi>Uzziah</hi> would have been.</p>
            <p>There is an opinion entertained amongſt many in theſe dayes, (and ſome of them good men too) that the Magiſtrate ought to meddle only with matters of the ſecond Table, not taking inſpection of things appertaining to the firſt; that he is only to maintaine civil peace amongſt men and outward righteouſneſſe, not heeding Religion or the Worſhip of God at all, as he is a Magiſtrate; If this once be received by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Jeſus Chriſt will be little beholden to them, they muſt as well protect the worſhippers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as of Chriſt ſo long as they keep the peace, and live in civil honeſty amongſt men; theſe men beleeve not the Magiſtrate to be Chriſts Officer as he is Mediatour and head of his Church, if they did they would be of another mind. But enough is ſaid againſt this woful aſſertion by Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> bloody tenet waſhed; by the Elders of <hi>N. Eng.</hi> in the Synod, <hi>Anno</hi> 1646. and by Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> in his book dedicated to your Highneſſe ſome few yeares ſince. And the bleſſing of the Lord upon the care of the godly Magiſtrates in <hi>N. E.</hi> hath been as a Seal to atteſt the Lords acceptance of what they have done there about this particular.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:164143:4"/>
            <p>The premiſes conſidered, I ſhould humbly offer to your Highneſſe, (may my preſumption herein be indulged) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two particulars wherein you may imploy that great power wich our Lord Jeſus hath betruſted you with, as his Delegate, for the promoting that great end, for which all power was firſt given to him by the Father, to wit, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good and welfare of his Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you would pleaſe to put forth your endeavours towards the uniting of the people of God in theſe Nations, who diſſenting in leſſer matters, do yet maintaine the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion, in whoſe ſpirits the vitals of Chriſtianity are ſtill preſerved, and in whoſe lives the power and practiſe of godlineſſe doth yet appear. And in order hereunto, that you would by your authority call together a few of the moſt judicious godly, and peaceable of ſuch Diſſenters, and lay your moſt ſolemn charge upon them that they would after (their fervent invocation on the Name of the Lord for direction and aſſiſtance in ſo great a work) ſtudy an holy and peaceable accommodation and agreement (ſo farre as may be in their principles, but eſpecially) in ſuch neceſſary Church practiſes, as the Churches of Chriſt amongſt us, may walk together with more Chriſtian love and unity. I ſhould hope (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing former diſappointments) the Lord would at laſt give them hearts to know what concerns their and the Churches peace, after they have had ſuch ſad experience of the evil fruits of our diviſions. And that then you would commend ſuch a pacificatory agreement to the Chriſtian people of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and give ſome more ſpecial encouragement to thoſe who ſhall be ſo tender of the Churches peace and union, as to practiſe according to the ſame. This were a work worthy of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, who by his office is to be an healer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.6, 7 and would give you the honour even to many generations, to be called the repairer of the breach, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of paths to dwell in.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:164143:5"/>
            <p n="2">II. That you would pleaſe to put ſome reſtrictions unto that (almoſt) boundleſſe Tolleration now amongſt us, whereby Seducers take liberty to broach ſuch curſed doctrines as are a diſhonour to the Name of Chriſt, and reproach and infamy to the Chriſtian Religion; ſuch as directly tend to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of the profeſſion and power of godlineſſe, and to the deſtruction of ſouls. Nothing can be more evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſpiritual welfare of the Church, the promoting whereof is the principal end of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (and not only the procuring of a civil good, which thing I cannot but often hint) then the free Tolleration of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious and heretical doctrines. It is not a thing unknown, That ſeducers have been more dangerous enemies to the Church then bloody perſecutors, where perſecution hath ſlain its thouſands, the deadly poiſon of falſe doctrine hath ſlain its ten thouſands; and when the one hath killed mens bodies, the other hath murdered mens ſouls; the Church hath ever thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under perſecution (the blood of the Martyrs being the ſeed of the Church, but it hath been brought very low under He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. If Magiſtrates be the Churches Nurs-fathers (as the Scripture ſpeaks,) ſure their Office not only obliges them, to take care that her children have the milk of the Word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to them, but that (as much as in them lieth) it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed purely and ſincerely without the mixture of poyſon to deſtroy them. Magiſtrates are called Shepherds. <hi>Iſa</hi> 44, 28. and that with reſpect to the Church, and therfore ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her from ravenous Wolves: they are called Gods, but they ſhould be poor gods, if they took no care of Religion. What ample teſtimonies hath the Lord given to <hi>David, Solomon, Aſa, Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah, Ioſiah</hi> for their care of Religion? nor will the names of <hi>Conſtantine, Theodotius, Iuſtinian</hi> ceaſe to be precious in and for their care of the Church of Chriſt. Even the Heathens, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> acknowledge (from the light within them, that the chiefe care in a Common-wealth
<pb facs="tcp:164143:5"/> ſhould be about Religion. But I preſume not to add more words for this, there being ſo much already ſaid in thoſe three Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes before mentioned for the ſame, and in particular againſt tolleration of ſeducers, all contrary arguments that have been made, being therein fully anſwered.</p>
            <p>Only I crave leave to adde this further, that I am not plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now againſt thoſe leſſer errours amongſt us, which will be ſo long as we are imperfect and know but in part; I ſhould deſire in behalf of ſuch as ſo erre, we might ſhew mutual love and forbearance, waiting, if any be otherwiſe minded, till the Lord reveal the ſame unto them: but againſt ſuch groſſe and damnable doctrines as were before named. Nor do I here call for fire to conſume ſuch as be ſeduced by ſuch doctrines, but I cry earneſtly for pity and compaſſion to be ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, to pull them as firebrands out of the fire. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but move our bowels to ſee ſome of our dear relations, friends and neighbours, to drink in greedily ſuch poyſonous principles (through the cunning craftineſſe of Seducers that lie in wait to deceive) as we know aſſuredly, if the Lord give them not repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth, will damn their precious and immortal ſouls; and to ſee other weak ones ſtumbled; and the efficacy of the Goſpel ſo much impeded in the bringing home ſouls to God, which hath been ſo prevalent a means in the hand of the Lord, till the pretious and fundamental truths of Chriſt have been called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and denyed by wicked deceivers amongſt us. We cannot but cry aloud to God and man whileſt we are eye-witneſſes of theſe things. It's true, Jeſus Chriſt is able without the help of men to maintain his own truths, and to call home, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Elect ones, and we doubt not but he will do it where means fail, even by miraculous providences and teſtimonies from heaven, but this is no warrant to us to neglect Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means; every one is to contend in their places for the truth, nor can we expect miracles till theſe ordinary means fail.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Highneſſe to look into the following
<pb facs="tcp:164143:6"/> Treatiſe, and you may ſee the abominable doctrines of thoſe people amongſt us called Quakers, faithfully preſented to your veiw; although I doubt not but you have ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them already, yet I would humbly minde you of them, whileſt your other weighty employments divert your thoughts otherwiſe; and incite you, out of your tenderneſſe to the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Delegate you are; out of your love to the Churches and people of God, for whoſe ſpiritual welfare you have this great power committed to you; and out of compaſſion to the periſhing ſouls of ſeduced people; to put ſome ſtop to thoſe ſeducers now in your Dominions, that they may not have ſuch freedom and licenſe by word and writing to broach ſuch damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; then which no duty can be more incumbent on you, as you are an Officer of Jeſus Chriſt in his political Kingdome, which we hope, he is about to eſtabliſh in the world more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly then in former ages.</p>
            <p>The Lord of heaven and earth bleſſe your Highneſſe with the continuance of his gracious preſence with you; keep your heart cloſe with himſelf in theſe back-ſliding times; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich you with all graces, that may fit you for the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your duty in ſo high and eminent a place; that as you have done valiantly in the high places of the field, ſo you govern as righteouſly and happily in the gates of the City.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not denyed but the Quakers are pretended friends to the Scriptures, and do often tell us that they own them: Nor can it be conceived that the <hi>Serpent</hi> ſhould ſo far loſe his <hi>ſubtilty</hi> in deceiving, and become ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an enemy to the truth, as to provoke ſeducers in downright words to deny and diſclaime them, and that eſpecially in an age, wherein (through the mercy of God) the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are generally entertained with ſo high eſteem, and ſome Laws are in force to puniſh ſuch as ſhall offend in ſuch a groſſe manner. His deſigne therefore muſt be to undermine them by policy, whileſt he pretends ſome love unto them, as <hi>Joab ſpake peaceably to Abner,</hi> whileſt he <hi>ſmote him under the fifth rib,</hi> and <hi>Judas kiſſed Chriſt when he betrayed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the Quakers are indeed real enemies to the Scriptures, whileſt they would ſeeme to be friends; I ſhall demonſtrate by ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>They deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God</hi> (as all that have any knowledge of them can teſtifie) appropriating this title only to Jeſus Chriſt, as ſometimes the <hi>Swenkfeildians</hi> and others have done, yea, in diſgrace of them have ſaid, <hi>ſome part thereof is the word of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the weakeſt may perceive their errour and enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scriptures in this particular. 1. Let them conſider theſe few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is nothing more common in our ordinary ſpeaking, then to call a ſpeech or a Sermon when they be Printed or Written, ſuch a mans ſpeech or Sermon, or the words that were ſpoken by a man, ſuch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:164143:9"/> a mans words,<note place="margin">Thus <hi>Nayler</hi> tells <hi>Jackſon</hi> p. 1. thou haſt printed my words.</note> though they be written down; this ſpeech is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that there's no childe that learns to read, but if it cannot tell a word, will ask, what word is this? and therefore to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is to inſinuate, they never came from God; if we underſtand this according to our common manner of ſpeaking; as when any deny ſuch a ſpeech, or ſuch words were not the words of ſuch a man, we underſtand thereby they never were uttered by him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures do frequently uſe the ſame manner of ſpeaking with us, in calling the Commandments, promiſes, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, &amp;c. recorded in the Scriptures the <hi>Word of God.</hi> The ten <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> that <hi>were engraven on the two Tables of ſtone</hi> are called <hi>ten Words,</hi>

See <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.17. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.27. the threatning which God ſpake againſt the <hi>houſe of Eli,</hi> is called the <hi>Word of the Lord.</hi> Yea, this is the moſt uſual acceptation of this title <hi>[the Word of God]</hi> for its not given to Jeſus Chriſt by any of the holy pen-men of the Scriptures, but by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> only in his Writings, as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:164143:9"/> further yet, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 19. and <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119. where the Prophet is taken up wholly in commendation of the Word of God, he ſhews you what word he ſpeaks of by the variety of expreſſions that he uſes, <hi>Law of God, Precepts, Judgements, Statutes, Ordinances, Commandments.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have not only the Word of God, but <hi>words of God</hi> mentioned in Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1. <hi>John</hi> 3.34. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 12.6. how can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this of Chriſt, except they make many Chriſts? and we reade not only of the Word Chriſt, but the <hi>work of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.16. Beſide, we finde mention in Scripture of a <hi>written word,</hi> Eccleſ. 12 10 <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22 <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.19. there might be hundreds of places more collected if need were, to make out this thing. How vainly do theſe men then cavil againſt us for calling the Scriptures the Word of God, ſeeing it is the uſual language of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had theſe poor people any knowledge of the original languages, wherein the Scriptures were written (of which it's ſtrange they ſhould be ignorant, when they pretend extraordinary gifts in other things, as of knowing mens ſpirits, of being infallible, of working miracles, &amp;c.) they might finde that there are ſeveral words uſed in Scripture that our tranſlators render the Word of God, there is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; now though the former title be given to Chriſt, yet the latter is not, and therefore ſuch places wherein the latter is uſed, can with no colour be expounded of Chriſt (as in <hi>Rom</hi> 10.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, &amp;c.) whatever they pretend of the former.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let it be conſidered in what reſpect Jeſus Chriſt is called the Word, and in what reſpect the Scriptures be called the Word; and it will appear this title will with greater propriety of Speech agree to the Scriptures then to Jeſus Chriſt, for Jeſus Chriſt is only figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Word of God; that he might through that ſimilitude he hath to a word, be more cleerly repreſented to our underſtandings; as the word is the image and reſemblance of ones minde, ſo is Jeſus Chriſt the expreſſe image of his Fathers perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. (though no tranſient image as our words be, but co-eſſential, and co-eternal) or as the word makes known what is in the minde and heart, ſo hath Chriſt made known the minde of God unto us; others underſtand he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the word alſo, becauſe its he of whom the Word ſpeaks, to him give all the Prophets witneſſe, &amp;c. others, becauſe he made all things by his Word, he ſpake, and they were made. But now in none of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; (nor any other that can be further named) is Chriſt properly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:164143:10"/> the word, but figuratively. But now the doctrines, precepts, &amp;c. of the Scriptures, may in a more proper ſenſe and without figure, be called the word of God, becauſe ſpoken by God; <hi>The Lord hath ſpoken theſe things by the mouth of his holy ſervants, which have been ſince the world began,</hi> Luke 1.70.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whereas they call ſome part of the Scriptures the word of the devil, intending thereby that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1, 4, 5. and ſuch like places. I anſwer they were the words uttered by the devil originally, but now as they be recorded by the penmen of the holy Scriptures, and ſo have a truth of hiſtory in them, they be the words of God, and therefore their malice againſt the Scriptures only appears herein.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It would be obſerved how ignorantly theſe men do contradict themſelves, in denying the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and yet granting them to be a declaration of Gods minde; let them tell what a word is? but a declaration of ones minde: cannot a childe know that if a man ſpeaks words to another, he declares his minde to him? what a ſimple contradiction is this to be found in men that pretend to be infallible? but any thing ſhall be ſaid or done to take down the authority of the holy Scriptures, and to leſſen the reverence due to them.</p>

               </note>II. <hi>They deny the Scriptures to be a rule of faith and life;</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeeking to overthrown the great uſe and end of the Scriptures, they are clearly manifeſted to be enemies to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>This charge will not be diſowned by them, for many of their pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets manifeſt their denial of the Scriptures to be a rule of faith and life, therefore it reſts on me to prove that they are enemies to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures herein, and this will appear in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Without ſome ſtanding rule and direction given by God, we know not how to beleeve in God aright, nor worſhip and ſerve him acceptably, and thereby attain eternal life; ſuch as have no ſtanding rule and direction, <hi>worſhip they know not what,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> John 4. <hi>They erre, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith to the <hi>Sadduces, Matth.</hi> 22.29. The Heathens that wanted the rule of the word, what dark apprehenſions and miſconceivings had they of God, and the things of God? how utterly ignorant of many myſteries of faith? how beſotted in worſhipping falſe gods, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived variouſly in their ſearching out the chief happineſſe of man? Man ſince the fall hath loſt the knowledge of God; and is ſtricken with blindneſſe, being able only to grope after God as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> for <hi>Lots door,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle phraſeth it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17 They <hi>feel</hi> (or grope) <hi>after him;</hi> and beſides the darkneſſe of mans minde, the ſeducements
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:164143:10"/> of Satan are ſuch <hi>(who can transform himſelf into an Angel of light)</hi> that if we have not ſomething to try the ſpirits by, we may ſoon be deceived, and therefore to have a rule or direction for mans faith and obedience is moſt neceſſary, ſeeing man is a reaſonable creature, and is not acted by a brute impulſe, but as a free and underſtanding agent, muſt act what he doth knowingly, and with Councel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's as certain that there is no other way ſufficient to direct man to beleeve in God aright, and to worſhip and ſerve him acceptably, and therby attain happineſſe, but the holy Scriptures. As for <hi>traditions of men</hi> (which the Jews formerly, and now the Papiſts equal with the Word of God) they lead men further from God and happineſſe. And for <hi>the light in the conſcience,</hi> (which the Quakers ſo highly cry up) though it may convince men there is a God, as we ſee by the Heathens that have no other teacher but it, yet is it unable to give a man any cleare diſtinct knowledge of God, only a groping knowledge (as before was ſaid) nor can it teach a man ſo much as the name of Chriſt; for which of the Heathens know this by the light in the conſcience? much leſſe the great myſteries of Chriſts incarnation or taking on him fleſh, of his death, and the new Covenant founded on it, his Reſurrection, Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c? And for matter of practiſe, though it will witneſſe againſt groſſe ſins and impieties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. yet how unable is it to convince of original ſin, (the firſt entrance of ſin into the world and death by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>) and of concupiſcence (or the motions of ſin in the fleſh) that it is ſinne when not conſented to, which the Papiſts deny to be ſinne (and it's likely the Quakers alſo, or elſe they would not affirm they are perfectly freed from the very being of ſin.) <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſely ſaith, <hi>he had not known it to be ſinne but by the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.7. (it ſeems then the light in his conſcience could not diſcover it.) How groſly ſuch have been miſled that have given up themſelves to heed that light (neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to uſe the Scriptures for their light and rule) appears ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in the printed relation of <hi>Gilpin</hi> and <hi>Toldervy;</hi> and by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, that this whole company are given up to by God, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to follow it. Further, as for ſuch <hi>ſpecial and immediate revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit,</hi> that others have boaſted of as their guide and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the woful miſcarriages of ſuch Enthuſiaſts that have pretended thereunto, may ſufficiently convince, God would have us to heed his word more, and try the ſpirits by that; and the groſſe and palpable blindneſſe of ſuch as want the direction of the Scriptures may ſhew, God is not pleaſed to uſe this way of immediate revelations now; nor indeed is it the work of God holy Spirit to diſcover things to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:164143:11"/> us now immediately, having already made a full diſcovery of them in the Scriptures, but to open our eyes to ſee the wonderful things of his Law, to apprehend thoſe diſcoveries of God made in his word, and to ſanctifie our hearts ſo as they may cloſe with thoſe truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and relliſh them, and to remove the natural enmity that is in as to the things of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It hath pleaſed the Lord of his infinite goodneſſe to give his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, the Word of God (for ſo now I will call them, whether the Quakers will or no) that this may be a direction and rule to us of faith and obedience, how we are to believe in God, and worſhip and ſerve him, and to direct us to eternal ſalvation, this is a ſpecial pledge of Gods love to us, though the enemies of truth will not acknowledge it, <hi>The Lord hath not done ſo to all Nations, neither have the heathen knowledge of his Laws,</hi> Pſalme 147 19, 20. and the end of writing them was, that we might be directed in our faith and obedience, <hi>John</hi> 20, laſt, <hi>Theſe things are written that ye might beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> we are to <hi>try the ſpirits</hi> now by them, whether <hi>they be of God,</hi> as the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. we are to go <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony,</hi> Iſa. 8.20. to ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhall be neceſſarily expoſed to errour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. They are now <hi>a lamp unto our feet,</hi> and <hi>a light unto our ſteps,</hi> Pſal. 119.105. and through the <hi>words of Gods lips, we may be kept from the path of the deſtroyer,</hi> Pſal. 17.4. in a word, they are <hi>able to make wiſe to ſalvation, to furniſh to all good works,</hi> they are <hi>profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction, inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. The Lord accompanying them with the bleſſing and efficacy of his Spirit. And let not any ignorantly pretend, it is a diſgrace to the Spirit to be tried, and regulated by an outward rule, for gold may be tryed by a touchſtone, why may not any doctrine or revelation or practice now, though pretended to come from the Spirit, be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Scriptures, which we are more ſure came from the Spirit of God, they being a <hi>ſurer word of prophecy,</hi> then any voice we can heare ſpoken from heaven, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now let the weakeſt Reader (if he be not wilfully blinded) judg, whether theſe people be not extreamly ingrateful to God for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in giving the Scriptures, to deny this principal uſe and end of the Scriptures, and whether hereby they declare not themſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies thereunto. I might ſhew other uſes and ends of the Scriptures that they ſubvert, but this may ſuffice for this ſecond particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to prove the charge, that the Quakers be enemies to the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:164143:11"/>
            <p n="3">III. They <hi>make Scriptures to be but a declaration of the Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> (an expreſſion frequently to be found in their writings) inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating thereby as if they belonged not to us now,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Burroughs</hi> p. 30 Glory from North. <hi>p.</hi> 8, 9.</note> but concerned the Saints only in former times, for ſo much its clear they intend by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this with the former particular they are the declaration of the Saints conditions in former times, but they are no rule of faith and life to us, what do they then concern us? what need we regard them? what benefit have we by them? A moſt unworthy expreſſion, when <hi>God hath written to us the great things of his word, and we account them a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſea 8.12. as if they did not at all concern us, and the Lord had not ſpoken thoſe things to us, but to others. But as it delares their enmity againſt the Scriptures, ſo is it a very falſe aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There be ſome part of the Scriptures that do more concern us now in theſe laſt dayes of the world, then they did the Saints in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, as many Prophetick Scriptures in <hi>Dauid</hi> and the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi> and for other Scriptures the Apoſtle faith, <hi>what ever was written, was written for our learning,</hi> Rom. 15.4. and for our <hi>admonition, upon whom the ends of the world be come,</hi> 1 Cor 10.6, 11. The example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles teaches us to make uſe of the whole Wood of God, they frequently cited the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the book of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> applying them to that generation, why may not we then apply the ſame, as alſo the writings of the New Teſtament for our benefit? In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. The Apoſtle applies that promiſe made to <hi>Joſhuah</hi> to the <hi>beleeving Hebrews. I will not have thee nor forſake thee.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. where the Apoſtle applies the promiſes made by the Prophet, <hi>Jer</hi> 31.1. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and preſſes them to duty from thence; and indeed to what end are they written down, and by the gracious providence of the Lord preſerved to this day, but for our uſe and benefit it's needleſſe to adde more here, that which was ſpoken in the former particular will alſo clear this.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. They <hi>call the Scriptures</hi> (reproachfully) <hi>a letter, a dead letter, &amp;c.</hi> as may be ſeen in their writings frequently, which is but a piece of Popiſh Rhetorick, for this hath been the language of Papiſts before them, who have called them a dead letter, divinity of ink and paper, with many more ſuch opprobrious tearms, But whether we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Papiſts and Quakers in vilifying the Scriptures, or credit the holy penmen their commendation of them, judge ye, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoule, the teſtimonies of the Lord are ſure, making wiſe the ſimple, the Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:164143:12"/> the heart; the Commandments of the Lord are pure, enlightning the eyes, &amp;c.</hi> and Pſalme 119.50. <hi>Thy word hath quickened me.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 1.18. ſaith, <hi>he begot us with the word of truth,</hi> Paul ſaith, <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God, Rom.</hi> 10.17. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; it's not ſaid by the perſonal word Jeſus Chriſt, but by the word that is preached by men, not that we exclude the co-operation of Gods Spirit with preaching, for we are <hi>workers together with God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. but that the word written and preached might have it's due place and commendation, <hi>being mighty through God, the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> and therefore no dead letter.</p>
            <p>It is a groſſe perverting of that Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. to alledge it for to prove the Scriptures to be a dead letter; for the Apoſtle there compares the doctrine or miniſtration of the Law and the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, with the miniſtration of the Goſpel Covenant, diſputing againſt ſuch as commended the Law above the Goſpel, and call'd men from the grace of Chriſt to the works of the Law, &amp;c. now the Law was but a dead killing letter, pronouncing a curſe and death; not could it quicken ſpiritually, there being no promiſe in it of writing the Law in our hearts; but in the ſame place he commends his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for the Miniſtery of the Spirit and of Life; therefore this place makes nothing for this wicked cavil of thoſe enemies againſt the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="5">V. They <hi>equal their books and pamphlets</hi> (though commonly ſtuft with non-ſenſe and railing, ever with wicked errors) <hi>to the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> then which, what can be more diſgraceful to the Scriptures, and more abominable to all ſober ſpirits? This appears clearly to all that have but read their papers, for thus they commonly write, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Lord, written from the Spirit of the Lord, given from the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and they boaſt commonly, that they ſpeak from God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and infallibly, as the Apoſtles did formerly. Whether this doth not bring them under that <hi>curſe,</hi> Rev. 22.18. for <hi>adding to the Scriptures,</hi> let them look to it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. They ſometimes plead the <hi>Church was a long time without the Scriptures,</hi> and therefore they are not neceſſary now, and if ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of thoſe books were burnt, they might do well enough, the light in them is ſufficient, &amp;c. This I teſtifie hath been objected to me, and there be others can witneſſe it with me. For the former part it is an old Popiſh Argument againſt the neceſſity of the Scriptures and I ſhall only reply what hath been anſwered the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to this formerly. <hi>Whitaker de perfec. Script. cap.</hi> 7. tells the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:164143:12"/> though of old time, when God familiarly ſhewed himſelf to the Fathers, and by himſelf manifeſted to them his will, the Scriptures were not neceſſary; yet after God did change the courſe of teaching his Church, and would have the Word written, then the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be neceſſary. To the latter part I anſwer, ſuch an expreſſion would ſuit the mouth of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> rebel, rather then of any ſober Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and therefore let him repent and pray, if perhaps the thought of his heart may be forgiven him.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. They appear <hi>enemies to the holy Scriptures in their daily practices,</hi> as their neglecting to uſe the holy Scriptures; Their ſpeakers ſpeak not out of the Scriptures as did Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17. who opened the book, and took his text out of <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.1. and in all his Sermons he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Scriptures, and proved all things by the Scriptures; nor do their ſpeakers exhort people to ſearch the Scriptures, to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to reading, meditation,<note place="margin">This they that have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent teſtifie.</note> &amp;c. but to look to the light in their conſciences, let them ſhew where ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles gave ſuch an exhortation to look to the light within them. And for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they follow not the example of the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> Acts 17.11. who ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo; but they take all ſpoken to them as given from God immediately, and turn not to the Scriptures to try the doctrines they hear by the Law and teſtimony: When they have no ſpeakers, they ſit as mutes together, looking on the ground, or looking at the light within them (as they ſay) but not looking on the Scriptures, nor conferring about them, though ſometimes they will read in their Aſſemblies, their quaking let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or books; beſides ſome of them have offered to ſell their Bibles. Now the moſt ignorant may eaſily judge by all this what friends they are to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>I might adde hereunto (if it were requiſite) to ſhew their enmity to the Scriptures, their <hi>perverſe wreſting of the Scriptures,</hi> in ſuch a manner ſometime, as ſhews they have neither knowledge of the Scriptures, nor any light of common underſtanding of men left in them. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> maintaining of perfection (as the Papiſts do) I brought him that place againſt it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.10. <hi>not a juſt man upon earth that doth good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not;</hi> he perverted it, as if <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſpeak of a man in an earthy condition. Another, when that cripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. was uſed to prove that we are not only to give God internal worſhip and ſervice, but outward and bodily, he replied the Church was he body that was to glorifie God. Again, when <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. cryed out, <hi>ob wretched man, &amp;c.</hi> he had not the Spirit. And that the ſame Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:164143:13"/> 11.14. did not at all condemne long hair. And many of them have ſaid, that the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. (ſaying, <hi>even ſo hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that they that preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi>) doth not plead for outward bodily maintenance, but their living by faith, or living ſpiritually on the Goſpel; were ever any people more blinded in the world then theſe? how dreadful a judgement is this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for leaving the Scriptures, and looking to the light in them, which appears by theſe things to be meer darkneſſe? I could fill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pages with ſuch inſtances of their perverſe wreſt of the Scriptures, but this will appear more fully in the following Sections. Let me but ſumme up theſe things together, and then let the Reader judge whether this firſt charge is not ſufficiently proved againſt them. The proof runs thus, if to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and thereby to inſinuate, they never came from God; if to deny the ſpecial uſe of the Scriptures to be a rule of faith and obedience; and to make as if they belonged to the Saints formerly, but did not concern us now; if to give vilifying expreſſions to them, and to call them a dead letter; if to equal fooliſh and wicked pamphlets with them; if to plead there's no neceſſity of them; if to practiſe to ſlight them and perverſly to wreſt them; if any, or if all of theſe together will prove the Quakers to be enemies to the holy Scriptures, then the charge ſtands good againſt them. Let the weakeſt hereby diſcern and ſee, and not be deceived by them; though they pretend in words never ſo fairly to the Scriptures. And thus for this firſt charge.</p>

               <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The Quakers deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, as alſo his Death, Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Aſcenſion, Interceſſion, and coming to Judgement.</head>
            <p>THe Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. ſpeaks of <hi>many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and Antichriſts come into the world, who confeſſe not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> and forbids <hi>to receive ſuch into your houſes,</hi> and <hi>to bid them God-ſpeed,</hi> for ſuch as do ſo, <hi>are partakers of their evil deeds:</hi> Let us therefore in the next place enquire whether the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers may be juſtly charged with this crime, that if they be found guilty thereof, all ſuch as profeſſe to be Chriſtians, may diſclaime them, and take heed of them as Deceivers and Antichriſts.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here firſt freely give Teſtimony for the Quakers, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in their behalfs, that they have the name of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:164143:13"/> often in their mouths and in their writings, and they will tell you in words they own Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh; ſo that if this will prove them good Chriſtians, they ſhall paſſe free from this cenſure, and not be charged with it.</p>
            <p>But withal I ſhall not conceale the ſubtilty of Satan in deceiving, in this (as well as in the former) particular; as he will let theſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments own the Scriptures in words, whileſt they deny them in deed and truth; and are enemies to them as before was proved: ſo whileſt they profeſſe in words to own Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, and ſpeak of his Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, &amp;c. they do in deed and in truth deny all theſe things.</p>
            <p>Nor let any wonder at this, they could not be deceivers elſe; they are ſimple deceivers, that will in plain and evident words ſay, they deny Jeſus Chriſt, they diſclaime his Incarnation, Death, Reſurrection, &amp;c. who would then be taken in their ſnares? the ſimpleſt would eſpy what they are? I finde not amongſt all the ancient hereticks in the Church, ſince the time of Chriſt to this day, any that have in expreſſe words ſaid, Chriſt is not come in the fleſh; though open enemies (ſuch as the Jews) deny it plainly, yet none that have profeſſed to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Some deceivers have ſaid, <hi>Chriſt took on him an imaginary</hi> (no real) <hi>body;</hi> ſome an <hi>aërial,</hi> ſome a <hi>coeleſtial,</hi> ſome a <hi>body,</hi> but <hi>no humane ſoul;</hi> ſome that his <hi>humane nature was ſwallowed up of his divine nature,</hi> and ſeveral other hereſies about it; and theſe all do in effect deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, becauſe they hold forth ſuch a Chriſt as is no real and true man, but none of them have denied it in expreſſe words, and why ſhould we think ſeducers ſhould be more fooliſh in deceiving in theſe laſt dayes of the world, then in former times? Beſides the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> he calls ſuch an one as ſhall not confeſſe Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, a crafty cheater or juggler, that will cozen you while you look on (ſo ſome expound the word) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt not think they wil in down-right words deny Chriſt, but while they look you in the face, and give you good words, and ſay, we own Chriſt come in the fleſh, and we are ſlandered by them that ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwiſe of us, yet they do but cozen and cheat you, for they nothing at all intend it.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if you examine the Quakers throughly, and ask them, <hi>what Chriſt it is they own now in the fleſh,</hi> they will confeſſe <hi>no other Chriſt</hi> but <hi>(the Chriſt of the familiſts) Chriſt in their fleſh;</hi> that in the conſcience they own to be Chriſt, but as for the <hi>man Chriſt now in the heavens</hi> him they own not; as for a Chriſt who is a particular man,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:164143:14"/> perſonally diſtinct from other men; that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that was <hi>of the ſeed of David, the Sonne of Mary, Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> they own not him; ſome have ſaid, <hi>he was the idol of the world;</hi> they will grant, that <hi>God took that fleſh for a time,</hi> but <hi>no humane ſoul with it,</hi> and <hi>when that man died on the croſſe, he never roſe againe in this ſame individual body; that ſame particular man did not aſcend into heaven, is not at the right hand of God making interceſſion, ſhall not come to judge the world, &amp;c.</hi> but all this by an <hi>allegory</hi> is applied to themſelves; <hi>Chriſt in the fleſh,</hi> is <hi>Chriſt in their fleſh,</hi> dying and riſing again in them, and now Chriſt is come to judge the world, while they take upon them with authority to judge and revile the ſervants and wayes of Chriſt. This is the very doctrine of the Quakers concerning Chriſts Incarnation, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, coming to Judgement, as may appear by theſe few teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies I ſhall hear ſet down; one of them in a printed paper, called, <hi>The ſword of the Lord drawn, &amp;c. p.</hi> 5. hath theſe words, <hi>Your imagined God beyond the ſtars, and your carnal Chriſt</hi> (for ſo they reproachfully call the man Chriſt Jeſus now in the heavens) <hi>is utterly denied and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified againſt by the light, &amp;c.</hi> In their book called <hi>Sauls errand to Damaſcus,</hi> p. 8, 9. 14. they ſay, <hi>That Chriſt in the fleſh, with all he did and ſuffered therein,</hi> was but a <hi>figure,</hi> and nothing but an <hi>example;</hi> ſome of them in theſe parts have publickly before many witneſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the <hi>Reſurrection of the dead body</hi> (and if ſo, then Chriſt is not riſen, and there's no ſuch man as the man Chriſt Jeſus now in heaven) <hi>B.

S. what became of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus</hi> when it was not to be found in the grave? anſwered, <hi>it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</hi> Another of them ſaid, <hi>Thou hopeſt to be ſaved by the Chriſt that died at Jeruſalem, but I truſt to a Chriſt within me,</hi> pointing to his breaſt; when that teſtimony of Chriſt which he gave concerning his Reſurrection, was urged to ſome of them, (in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. <hi>The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſuppoſing they ſaw a ſpirit,</hi> and that it was not Chriſt himſelf, he ſaid unto them, <hi>behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf, a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me have;</hi>) they have ſcoffingly anſwered, <hi>where was his blood?</hi> that was ſpilt upon the croſſe; they have often urged Chriſts appearing to his Diſciples, the doors being ſhut, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that <hi>Chriſt roſe not with a corporal body of fleſh and bones,</hi> though at the ſame time he bid unbeleeving <hi>Thomas</hi> behold his hands, and reach his finger and thruſt it into his ſide. They frequently ſpeak of a Chriſt <hi>in their conſcience,</hi> as the only Chriſt; for no other man Chriſt they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:164143:14"/> will acknowledge. There needs no further proof of this charge, let but any one that deſires further ſatisfaction concerning it, ask them (as I my ſelf have often proved it by experience in conference with them,) whether they acknowledge a man Chriſt perſonally diſtinct from other men, now reſiding in the higheſt heavens, who is to come to judge the world at the laſt day? they will tell you they own the ſame Chriſt that ever was (for they deny not his divinity) but for his humanity they will ſhufle you off, and not ſpeak to that, and thereby prove themſelves Anti-chriſts, becauſe they confeſſe not Chriſt in the fleſh, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I need not ſpend many words in the confutation of theſe things, there is no ſober Chriſtian that hath received any thing of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, but his heart wil abhor theſe doctrines at the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of them. I ſhall only refer the Reader to ſome Scriptures, that may eſtabliſh his faith in the truth about theſe particulars. Concerning <hi>Chriſts being really and truly a man.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. That he was a <hi>particular, individual man, perſonally diſtinct from all other men,</hi> (and not a man as he dwells in the fleſh of other men) appears, becauſe he is deſcribed to be a man coming <hi>of the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, of the Tribe of Judah, of the family of David, born of</hi> a particular woman, <hi>the Virgin Mary,</hi> not of other women; and in that the great doctrine concerning Chriſt to be beleeved (which the Scriptures ſpeaks of) was that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that particular man <hi>was the Chriſt, That he had a humane or reaſonable ſoul,</hi> beſides his God-head or divine nature. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. <hi>John</hi> 12.27. And that (after this man Chriſt was crucified, <hi>he aroſe again with the ſame individual body that ſuffered on the croſſe,</hi> though made more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, appears by the many witneſſes that teſtified it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. and 3.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. (indeed it was the great work of the Apoſtles to teſtifie it, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22.) nor could theſe witneſſes be deceived; for,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) There were many that did ſee him, the eleven Apoſtles, and five hundred brethren at once.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) They not only did ſee him, but heard him ſpeak, and did eat with him, nay, felt his prints and marks, and himſelf affirmed he had fleſh and bones ſtill.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) And he continued fourty dayes among them; beſides the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from heaven teſtified the ſame thing, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.3, 5, 6. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.6. and the very ſouldiers that kept watch, bare witneſſe to it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.11. Further, that <hi>this ſame individual perſon did aſcend into heaven,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:164143:15"/> even above the viſible heavens, and <hi>is there preſent making interceſſion for us at the right hand of God, and ſhall come again to judge the quick and dead at the laſt day.</hi> See theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.51. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31.</p>
            <p>But ſome Scriptures thoſe people do wreſt to make for their purpoſe, which leſt they deceive weak ones by them, I ſhall vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſpeak much of that Scripture, 1 <hi>Col Chriſt in you the hope of glory,</hi> and of all thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſts being, living, or dwelling in his people thereby to inſinuate there is no other man Chriſt, but Chriſt in us men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall not ſpeak now of the nature of Chriſts in-dwelling or in-being in his people, till I come to the fourth Section, where I ſhall have occaſion to open it more diſtinctly; onely thus much for the preſent; <hi>Chriſts dwelling in his people now is by his Spirit, and not according to his humane nature,</hi> for this the heavens do containe, till he deſcend viſibly to judge the world, as he was ſeen to aſcend, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. But it is by his ſpirit he dwells now in his people, which is infinite and fills all places, (and ſo doth not his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, being a created thing and finite) ſee this cleer from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10, 11. in <hi>v.</hi> 10. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Christ being in you,</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 11. he explaines the expreſſion by ſhewing the manner of it, <hi>by his Spirit dwelling in you:</hi> And indeed we muſt thus have Chriſt in us by his Spirit, or elſe we can have no aſſured hope of glory; though the meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation and glory is Chriſts obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death performed in his own perſon, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7, 11, 14, &amp;c. yet we can have no evidence of our right to glory, but by finding Chriſts in-being in us by his Spirit now, ſo that theſe Scriptures are utterly perverted to make for their ends.</p>
            <p>Further, that Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh: yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh: yet now henceforth know we him no more;</hi> is as groſly abuſed, when it is made to ſpeak againſt that particular man Chriſt Jeſus now in heaven, &amp;c. for,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) This doctrine concerning the man Chriſt Jeſus his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. the Apoſtle had before aſſerted in many places (as we ſhewed even now, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the beginning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3, 4. &amp;c.) and he doth not now deſtroy what before he built; it was the great thing the Apoſtles were to teſtifie and witneſſe to the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22. they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:164143:15"/> were to be witneſſes of his Reſurrection; this Apoſtle doth in more then twenty places in his Epiſtles teſtifie, how that the man Chriſt indeed was riſen from the dead, and aſcended into heaven, &amp;c. therefore he doth not contradict in this place what he lays down in ſo many other places.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) And therefore we muſt enquire after another interpretation of that Scripture, and it will clearly appear to be this. The falſe apoſtles had vilified the Apoſtles Miniſtry, that they might draw away the hearts of people from him, (according to the practiſe of the Quakers in theſe dayes, for this is an old trick of Satan) and one plea they had againſt him, was this, he had not converſed with Chriſt upon earth, as had the other Apoſtles, and therfore he was not ſo much to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off: The Apoſtle hints we are not to look on Chriſt under ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward relations, as if there were ſo much benefit by being related to Chriſt in the fleſh, or by being in his bodily preſence; but we are to conſider him as having compleated the work of our redemption, having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome death, being raiſed up in glory, and aſcended into heaven, and thus we ſhould know him for the future, this is the ſpring of a Chriſtians comfort; thus he ſpeaks not againſt Chriſts being in the fleſh ſtill (which other Scriptures clearly witneſſe) but againſt looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him under theſe carnal relations they ſtood in to him whileſt he was upon earth; this will appear more fully to be the Apoſtles mind, by conſidering the various acceptation of the word <hi>[fleſh]</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which to avoid tediouſneſſe I omit here, intending to ſpeak of it in Sect. 6. where in proving the reſurrection of our dead bodies, I ſhall further prove the truth of Chriſts reſurrection, and that ſtill he is really and truly in our natures in heaven, even in the ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar body he had upon earth, though glorified; and indeed, if this were not ſo, the Apoſtles were falſe witneſſes, <hi>our faith is in vaine,</hi> we are <hi>yet in our ſins,</hi> and <hi>they who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.15, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus for the clearing of this ſecond charge, That the Quakers deny Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, overthrow his Incarnation, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Interceſſion and coming to Judgement, and thereby pull down the maine pillars of Chriſtianity, and overthrow the faith and comfort of Chriſtians, and that while they pretend to be more ſpiritual (but are indeed deceivers herein) turning all into Allegories, and faining theſe things done in the true Chriſt to be but as a ſhadow of what is now really done in them; From this it is clear the Quakers-chriſt and Ours is not the ſame: they hold no other man
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:164143:16"/> Chriſt but in their conſciences; we beleeve our Chriſt is in heaven, and do wait for him to come from heaven, who was raiſed up from the dead; even <hi>Jeſus which delivereth us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10. Let all that profeſſe the Name of Chriſt take heed of ſuch as preach another Chriſt, then whom they have received, and look upon them as Deceivers and Anti-chriſts, as for us we have not ſo learned Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The Quakers deny the Doctrine of the Trinity.</head>
            <p>THis charge will not be denied by the Quakers, for in this they ſpeak out, and do not ſeek to conceale their opinions, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not one God ſubſiſting in three perſons. (See <hi>Sauls er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to Damaſcus,</hi> p. 12. and the <hi>ſword of the Lord drawn, &amp;c. p.</hi> 4. where this doctrine is called a lie by them.)</p>
            <p>Let me therefore ſhew this to be an abominable errour contrary to the doctrine of the Scriptures, to deny three perſons ſubſiſting in one God, and prove this fundamental article of our faith againſt their cavils; This I cleare from Scripture by theſe gradations or ſteps.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scriptures ſpeak clearly that there is in the <hi>divine nature three in one,</hi> or a Trinity in Unity (whether theſe three may be called perſons, we ſhall diſcuſſe afterwards) 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There be three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> Here is in this Scripture three numbred, and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names ſet down, and yet it's ſaid, <hi>they are but one;</hi> (not only agree in one, as in the next verſe, but <hi>they are one.</hi>) See <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>John</hi> 14.16. Where are alſo three counted, the Father and I: (ſaith Chriſt) and the Spirit of truth, and theſe are diſtinguiſhed, the Spirit is called <hi>another.</hi> It might further be ſhewed; as, there be three numbred in Scripture, and their ſeveral names ſet down; ſo the Scripture ſpeak alſo of diſtinct properties and operations peculiar to each of theſe three, and incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to other; <hi>The Father begets</hi> and not the Son; the <hi>Spirit proceeds</hi> and not the Father, &amp;c. ſo the <hi>Sonne took fleſh,</hi> and not the Father, nor the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It's moſt evident that this Trinity in Unity, or three in one is not <hi>a meer notional thing ſubſiſting in the minde</hi> and apprehenſion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:164143:16"/> of man alone, but <hi>eternally ſubſiſting in the divine being it ſelf;</hi> it's a thing founded upon Scripture, as before was ſhewed, not a fiction of reaſon, it had been if there never had been any created minde to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. Nor can it be only <hi>three names given to one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal being,</hi> for the Scripture gives more names then three to God, there are <hi>ten ſeveral names</hi> given to God in the Old Teſtament, as ſome obſerve, beſides thoſe in the New Teſtament, and further the Scripture counts them as diſtinct in ſubſiſtence and not only in name, <hi>John</hi> 8.17, 18. Chriſt and his Father are counted for two witneſſes, now one perſon cannot be two witneſſes, though he have two names. Nor doth this <hi>Trinity ſubſiſt in the divine nature only, as wiſdome, juſtice and goodneſſe are in God;</hi> for theſe attributes of God are no otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed then according to mans apprehenſion of them, becauſe our finite and compounded underſtandings cannot comprehend the glorious perfections of a ſingle and infinite eſſence, but by diſtinct properties or attributes, in themſelves they do not differ one from another (the ſame alſo may be ſaid of Gods decrees,) but now this diſtinction of three in one is founded in the very divine being it ſelf, as before was ſhewed. Nor yet further are we to underſtand this three in one to be <hi>only three manifeſtations of God grounded upon ſome offices or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſpenſations to the creature in time,</hi> there hath been more manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of God to man then three ſince the creation, God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt various wayes to his people, to <hi>Moſes in the buſh,</hi> and <hi>in the mount;</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> in the <hi>pillar of fire and cloud,</hi> to the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> to the <hi>three children,</hi> to <hi>Daniel,</hi> to <hi>John, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction was in God from eternity, before there was any creature made to manifeſt it unto; Chriſt is the eternal Sonne of God, diſtinct from the Father eternally, and before he was made fleſh; the Spirit was diſtinguiſhed from Father and Sonne from eternity, and not only when he was manifeſted in deſcending on Chriſt in the likeneſſe of a dove, or by falling on the Apoſtles in fiery tongues. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.21. to 31. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20 theſe are all to be exploded as dangerous errours, and have been ever rejected by the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Hence it will follow, that this muſt be a Trinity of perſons, or ſubſiſtances in the ſame divine being, <hi>three perſons ſubſiſting in one God,</hi> nor let any cavil at the word <hi>[perſon]</hi> for it is a Scripture word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. if they will ſtand to the received tranſlation, if any will plead the word is more properly rendred there <hi>[ſubſistence]</hi> then perſon, we will not ſtand upon that, ſo they acknowledge three ſubſiſtances in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:164143:17"/> ſame divine being, for this is all we argue for; but how vainly is it to except againſt the word <hi>[perſon]</hi> ſo commonly received amongſt the people of God, and not ſcrupled at by any, but ſuch as have erred dangerouſly in other things? <hi>what is a perſon,</hi> if we look upon the notation of the name, but <hi>per ſe una, a thing that hath a ſubſiſtence by it ſelf?</hi> or if we reſpect the definition of the thing, we underſtand no more by it, but an intelligent, compleat, incommunicable, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſubſiſtence; and according to our common cuſtome of ſpeech, the word <hi>perſon</hi> doth expreſſe more excellency then the word <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,</hi> ſingly taken, doth; the former we ever apply to a reaſonable being, the other we uſe to apply to inferiour creatures, a beaſt may be ſaid to ſubſiſt though it is no perſon.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Yet is <hi>there no multiplication of the God-head,</hi> for ſtill we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one God, one ſimple undivided eſſence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.6, 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.21, 22. <hi>John</hi> 10.30 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> If any ſhall object, how can theſe things be? it ſeems a contradiction for to ſay there is three perſons, and yet but one divine being, and therefore ſhall reject this doctrine becauſe they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> I anſwer, it were extreame arrogance for a poor worm to do thus, to reject what God hath clearly held forth in his Word, becauſe he cannot comprehend it; what Art or Science is there in the world, but there are many myſteries in it, that novices cannot comprehend? and can we expect to be more knowing in the things of God, that are ſo high and myſterious above the reaſon and underſtanding of man? Let ſober ſpirits count it their ſafeſt way to beleeve what is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God, though they cannot yet comprehend the nature of ſuch myſteries. Nevertheleſſe we do not count it a contradiction to ſay there is light, heat, and power in the Sun, and yet there are not three Suns but one; or that in the ſoul there is the vegetative, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and rational faculties, and yet there are not three ſouls in man, but one: why ſhould it ſeem then a contradiction to believe three perſons to ſubſiſt in one only God?</p>
            <p>Now let the Reader from hence ſee what impudence it is in theſe Quakers to call this doctrine a lie, and how dangerouſly they erre in denying the <hi>Trinity;</hi> what is this but to deny the true God, who hath manifeſted himſelf thus, to be one in three? (as before they denied the Man Chriſt, and were proved enemies to the Scriptures) this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour tends to ouerthrow all faith and Religion, and is pernicious to mens ſalvation; for, we muſt believe in God as he reveals himſelf in his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:164143:17"/> Word and no otherwiſe, and worſhip and ſerve him accordingly, if we will be ſaved; It was hatched by the enemies of truth, it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended on purpoſe to overthrow the perſonal Deity of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the infinite value of his merits is taken away, and to undermine the perſonality of the Spirit, which is ſo fully evidenced by the divine attributes appropriated to him in Scripture; and therefore have the pureſt Churches of Chriſt ever diſclaimed communion with ſuch as deny the doctrine of the Trinity, accounting them ſubverters of the fundamentals of Religion. And thus for this third particular.</p>

Another of them argued with me, that <hi>the ſoul after its departure out of the body</hi> (which ſay they, rots in the grave and never riſes again) <hi>is taken up into God, and is one being with him,</hi> urging that Scripture for it, <hi>God ſhall be all in all.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall therefore for the benefit of the weak open the manner of Chriſts in-being or in-dwelling in beleevers, leſt they not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it, ſhould ſtumble at theſe Scriptures. This in-dwelling or in-being of Chriſt and oneneſſe with him is held forth in many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>John</hi> 6 56. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5, <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 17.21. now, how ſhould we underſtand this? what! God to dwell in his Saints, Chriſt to be and inhabit in beleevers, how can this be? the heaven of heavens cannot containe him, how much leſſe the ſtrait heart of man? Know,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Negatively,</hi> you muſt not underſtand this in-being or in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſt to be either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A corporeal inhabitation,</hi> as if the body of Chriſt or his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dwelt in us, which was the groſſe conceit of the <hi>Capernaites, John</hi> 6. and is to this day the opinion of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries,</hi> who imagine Chriſts body to have the properties of the divine nature communicated to it, to be immenſe, and to be in many places at once, (and this muſt be the conceit of the Quakers if they hold any man Chriſt at all, for they deny any Man Chriſt but in us men) This is a groſſe miſtake, it overthrows the truth of Chriſts Man-hood; and the Scriptures expreſly ſay, <hi>The heavens muſt containe him;</hi> and this man Chriſt comes not till he deſcends to judge the world; beſides, the Scriptures teach that Chriſts being in us is ſpiritual, not bodily, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is it an <hi>eſſential in-dwelling of the divine nature in Gods people,</hi> as if the very being of God were communicated to us and dwelt in us; though the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of the divine nature being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Saints, yet he expreſſes other where what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands thereby, namely the divine graces and vertues of the Spirit. Indeed how can the being of God which is infinite and boundleſſe be in one place or perſon more then in another, though his graces may?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor is it a <hi>Perſonal in-being</hi> as the ſoul lives in the body, and is one ſubſiſtence with it, thus the <hi>fulneſſe of the God-head dwelt in Chriſt by perſonal or hypoſtatical union;</hi> but thus God is not in his Saints, then they ſhould be gods, as Chriſt was God, this is the blaſphemy of <hi>Familiſts,</hi> who ſay they are godded and chriſted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> Chriſt dwelleth and is in his Saints (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures) two ways;</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:164143:19"/>
            <p n="1">1. By his <hi>ſpecial ſpiritual preſence,</hi> he is more eſpecially preſent with and in the hearts of his Saints then with others, by his gracious manifeſtations, by his ſweet influences, and by his wonderful operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon their hearts, ſo God dwelt in the Temple formerly, and ſo he dwells in heaven now; in the Temple, God ſaid, <hi>This is my reſt, here I will dwell;</hi> he manifeſted himſelf to his people there, he heard their prayers, gave forth his oracles, there they had communion with God in his Ordinances, they ſaw his face in the Sanctuary, &amp;c. and ſo now in heaven God is ſaid to dwell there, becauſe he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts his glorious preſence there eſpecially, in that place the Saints ſhall have the viſion and fruition of God eternally. Thus in the ſame manner God dwells in his people now, by ſpecial ſpiritual preſence, he makes ſuch manifeſtations of himſelf to them as none beſides have, they ſee his face, know more of his minde, have more of his love-vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits then others have, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. he refreſhes them with <hi>his flaggons of wine</hi> and <hi>his hidden Mannah,</hi> fills them with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, peace, and joy of his Spirit: He vouchſafes to them ſuch divine influences of grace as others have not; ſuch quicknings and breathings of his Spirit, as fills their hearts with ſpiritual vigour and life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lives they live alſo. And he doth ſuch mighty works in them as in none elſe, puts forth the ſame power that was put forth in raiſing Chriſt from the dead, to mortifie corruptions in them, to ſtrengthen them to beleeve, and to do the works of God, to frame them according to the image of God, &amp;c. <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>myſtical union,</hi> and this is more then the former, one may have a dwelling in an houſe but no union with it; God dwelt in the Temple, but was not one with it; he dwells in the heavens, but hath no union with them; but he ſo dwells in beleevers, as he is one with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>John</hi> 17.21. This oneneſſe is ſo near, that it excels all the unions upon earth, the Scripture uſes the compariſons of <hi>husband and wife,</hi> Eph. 5. of <hi>head and members.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. of <hi>ſoul and body,</hi> Gal. 2 20. of <hi>root and branches,</hi> John 15. to ſet it forth by; and yet all theſe be too ſhort, he addes the union betwixt the Father and Son (<hi>John</hi> 17.) to commend it further; yet muſt not be ſo preſumptuouſly wreſted, as to plead for an eſſential or perſonal union to make us gods All theſe compariſons are uſed in Scripture, not becauſe they ſuit in al things, but that we may by theſe ſee what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable relation we ſtand in to God, and what bleſſings we may expect to be communicated to us by vertue thereof. If any expect I ſhould
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:164143:20"/> give ſome name to that union to expreſſe what it is further, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay no more but this, it is a great myſtery, and cannot be fully comprehended by the Saints here, till God wipe away this duſt of mortality from their eyes; Its ſafeſt to profeſſe here we know but in part; if any will profeſſe to know more in theſe Myſteries, let them firſt tell the nature of the union of their own ſouls and bodies, and how a ſpiritual and corporal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould be ſo knit together, to become one man? what is the bond of this union, and how effected? when they can explicate theſe inferiour things, its more likely we ſhould liſten to them in explaining theſe higher Myſteries about the union of Chriſt and beleevers.</p>
            <p>By this time the Reader may ſee what pride and arrogance it is in theſe people to hold equality with God, and to make the ſoule a part of God, or one being with God: is not this greater pride then was in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he fell (and perhaps in the devils themſelves,) for he aſpired to be but as God, not to be God himſelfe or one being with as theſe men do? But enough of this abominable doctrine. And thus for the fourth generall Charge.</p>

               <hi>SECT. V.</hi> The Quakers corrupt the Doctrine of Juſtification.</head>
            <p>THe Doctrine of the Juſtification of a beleeving ſinner before God, is one of the moſt precious and comfortable doctrines of the Goſpel, tending exceedingly to ſet forth the riches of Gods free grace, and magnifie his juſtice to ſupport and comfort wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; to take away boaſting from man, that all may glory in the Lord; and to fill the heart with joy and peace in beleeving: And therefore the devil hath by his inſtruments in all ages, laboured to corrupt the ſame. He ſtirr'd up falſe apoſtles in the firſt plantation of the Chriſtian faith to pervert it, againſt whom the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> diſputes earneſtly, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are juſtified by faith, and not by works; by faith receiving the righteouſneſſe of another, not by works wrought in or by our ſelves. In after ages the Papiſts were the great ſubverters of this doctrine, who had ſo corrupted it, that no part thereof was left pure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:164143:20"/> and undepraved by them; till the Lord of his mercy raiſed up <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and ſome other Worthies to vindicate it; and indeed the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of this doctrine were the great and eſpecial cauſe of their firſt ſeparation from <hi>Rome,</hi> and there was nothing that the Spirit of that precious man was more drawn out to clear, then that very doctrine, as may appear by his writings. In the ſteps of thoſe enemies of the truth the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> do theſe generation of Quakers now ſo exactly walk, (as to the perverting of this doctrine of <hi>Juſtification</hi>) that they ſcarce differ an hairs breadth from them, holding forth the old Popiſh doctrine in the very ſame terms, as will appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Papiſts deny Juſtification to be a <hi>judicial act</hi> of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he accounts us righteous (though ungodly in our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.) through the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, performed in his own perſon for us, imputed to us, and received by faith alone; but make it to conſiſt in the infuſing or putting in righteouſneſſe into man, and ſo confound Juſtification and Sanctification, making them one and the ſame thing. So <hi>Bellarm.</hi> the Jeſuite, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Juſtif. cap.</hi> 1. And ſo the Quakers: <hi>J. Nailer</hi> love to the loſt,<note place="margin">See <hi>Sauls</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond to <hi>Dam.</hi> p. 12.</note> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>pleads for our being made righteous by Gods putting in righteouſneſs into us, and by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought in the creature;</hi> in the ſame page, line 4. he explaines Gods imputing righteouſneſſe to be his putting it into the creature; his words are theſe, <hi>[righteouſneſs is freely imputed or put into the creature]</hi> where let the Reader ſee the groſſe ignorance of a man that pretends to be infallible, making <hi>[impute, and put in]</hi> the ſame, whereas any School-boy that hath but learnt his Grammar, may ſee a vaſt difference between them; the word <hi>[impute]</hi> not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of [put in, or in put] but coming from <hi>imputo,</hi> to <hi>reckon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, judge, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> tranſlated in the Scriptures [impute] do ſignifie; can any beleeve this man is infallible in his doctrine, when he is ſo groſſely miſtaken in a word ſo commonly uſed in the Scriptures? See alſo <hi>Nailer</hi> in the ſame book, <hi>p.</hi> 50. where he (directly according to the manner of the Papiſts) confounds Juſtification, Sanctification, and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication together, and argues for it as they do, though in a more ſimple manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Papists</hi> (as a conſequent of the former opinion) hold, that they are able to <hi>keep the Law perfectly,</hi> and <hi>to be perfectly righteous,</hi> Counc. Trent. Seſſ. 6. can. 18. Nay, <hi>If any man ſay that the precepts and Commandments of God unto a man juſtified, and in the ſtate of grace
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:164143:21"/> be impoſſible to be kept, let him be accurſed:</hi> So the Quakers, <hi>Nailer p.</hi> 21, 22. of the book before named, and in his book called the <hi>glory of the Lord out of the North, p.</hi> 25, 26. he argues as hotly for it, as if ſome Jeſuite were at his back to prompt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The papiſts ſay, <hi>by the liberty of the Goſpel, they are altogether freed from ſinne,</hi> ſo that it is throughly dead, and not only not imputed, but not alive or having any being in the righteous; they are the words of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Jeſuite, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Juſtif. cap.</hi> 6. The ſame thing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues <hi>Nailer</hi> for; <hi>Glory from the North,</hi> p. 21. <hi>Love to the loſt.</hi> p. 21, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> they exclaime againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (who teach they have yet ſinne in them, and are not ſo perfectly righteous as to ſtand before the judgement ſeat of God without the righteouſneſſe of their Surety) and call them painted Sepulchers, faire without, and foule within, leprous perſons in fine cloaths, with many other ſuch expreſſions. See <hi>Becanus</hi> the Jeſuite, <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>tract.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 1, <hi>and</hi> 3. So the Quakers, <hi>J. Nailer, love to the loſt,</hi> p. 4. you make (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe a cover to your abominations, &amp;c.</hi> Though we doubt not but God will vindicate our uprightneſſe, that we are as conſciencious of walking holily as any Papiſts or Quaker of them all, though we dare not ſeek Juſtification thereby, this the very Papiſts have been forced to confeſſe ſometimes, ſaying, though we had an <hi>heretical faith, yet we had Orthodox man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the Popiſh doctrine of Juſtification brought in by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men, that cry out againſt all others as Popiſh and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, when in the mean time they are moſt deeply guilty of it themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now that the ignorant may not be deceived about this point, which is one of the fundamental doctrines of Religion. I ſhall cleare up the truth concerning it, according to the Scriptures, in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He that will be juſtified before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, and be acquitted and pronounced righteous by the Judge of heaven and earth at the great day of the Lord, muſt be perfectly righteous, he muſt not have the guilt of the leaſt ſinne to be charged upon him; Curſed is he that continueth not in all things written in the Law to do them; this Judg is of purer eyes then to behold any iniquity to approve thereof; he that juſtifieth the wicked is abomination unto him,</hi> and therefore he will not do it himſelf, he is perfectly righteous himſelf; his Law is perfectly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:164143:21"/> righteous, he will not be bribed any away, nor reſpect perſons, and therefore they muſt have a perfect ſpotleſſe righteouſneſſe that ſtand before him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such is the impurity and ſinfulneſſe of the natures, hearts and lives of the beſt men living, that they cannot produce ſuch a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before God,</hi> as that before mentioned; for, beſides the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin and diſobedience to all born of him by ordinary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, every man hath a ſinful nature in him, which, till he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated and converted, doth carry him captive to ſinne daily, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. And this would condemne him, though he ſhould after converſion live never ſo perfectly, unleſſe the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and ſatisfaction of a Surety and Mediatour be imputed to him; And after converſion the beſt of the Saints, whoſe hearts are renued, and the dominion of ſinne brought down in them, do not live ſo free from ſin, but that <hi>in many things they offend all,</hi> James 3.2. and <hi>if they ſhould ſay, they have no ſin, they deceive themſelves, and the truth is not in them,</hi> 1 John 1.8. they may ſay with <hi>Job, how ſhall a man be juſt before God, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand,</hi> and with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſinneth not;</hi> which of all the Saints have not ſome blemiſhes recorded, even after the Lord gave them teſtimony that they were accepted of him? <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 7.1. hath witneſſe of God to be a <hi>righteous man</hi> in a ſinful generation, yet we read he ſinned afterward, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Job</hi> had teſtimony of God to be a <hi>perfect man and upright, fearing God, &amp;c.</hi> and yet we read afterwards of his impatiency, and he confeſſes his ſinnes and vileneſſe; his perfection was in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his heart, having reſpect to all Gods Commandments, not in his perfect freedome from the being of ſin. <hi>David,</hi> after he was declared a man <hi>after Gods own heart,</hi> how ſadly did he fall? and <hi>Solomon</hi> after he had ſeen God twice? <hi>Pauls</hi> complaints are known, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. and <hi>Peters</hi> miſcarriages not only after his glorious confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16 but after the ſpirit was ſo plentifully poured on him in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> for <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul</hi> charges him for not walking uprightly (in a particular thing there mentioned) and for diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> The Quakers object, this is the time of their warfare, and therefore as yet they had not attained to that perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> I anſwer, it was after their converſion, after they had more of the grace and Spirit of Chriſt then any proud Papiſt or Quaker now hath; and for their warfare, it's true, it was not over, nor can ours be expected to be paſt ſo long as we are in the body, all the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:164143:22"/> dayes of our life here, are the time of our warfare. Thus for the ſecond particular, ſuch a perfect righteouſneſſe is not to be found in any man living which may ſtand at Gods judgement barre.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Such is the goodneſſe of the Lord to poor man, that he hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that for him in Chriſt, that he could not have in himſelf, even this perfect righteouſneſſe;</hi> when we were found tranſgreſſours before God, and ſo to be condemned; he gives his Sonne to <hi>fulfil all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for us; he is made of God unto us righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>ſin for us that knew no ſin, that we might become the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in him;</hi> we are made righteous or juſtified by him, as he was made ſinne and guilty by us, that is, <hi>imputatively,</hi> not <hi>inherently,</hi> for <hi>he had no ſin in him,</hi> though he took guilt upon him. What was impoſſible to be found in us, becauſe of the weakneſs of the fleſh, is now found in Chriſt for us, who is <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6.</p>
            <p>Now here is a perfect righteouſneſs, he was for his perſon, <hi>holy, harmleſs, and ſeparate from ſinners;</hi> for his life, there was no evil found in him; he obeyed the Law perfectly, and by his death did ſatisfie whatever the Law could demand, there could not be a farthing more required of him, elſe he had not riſen againe and been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed out of priſon, God gave Teſtimony he was well pleaſed in him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But now <hi>this righteouſneſs thus wrought in the perſon of Chriſt muſt be made ours before we be juſtified by it,</hi> and how can that be? this the Papiſts ſcoff at, ſaying; can a man be beautiful by another mans beauty, or wiſe by his wiſdome? can a malefactour be acquitted becauſe another man is righteous? and Quakers mock at our truſting to be juſtified and ſaved by him that died at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt may as truly be made ours, and we juſtified by it, as ſometimes a debtor is diſcharged by his ſurety or friend paying the debt for him, or a malefactour is acquitted when another undergoes the penalty of the Law for him.</p>
            <p>To make this clear, ſomething muſt be conſidered as done on Gods part, and ſomething as done on our part.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>On Gods part,</hi> there be theſe two things done to make this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt ours, ſo as we may be juſtified by it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>A mutual compact or agreement betwixt the Father and his Son,</hi> that all that Chriſt ſhould be, do and ſuffer, ſhould not be for himſelf, but for us in our ſtead and place, as our <hi>ſurety,</hi> he died for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:164143:22"/> he roſe again for <hi>our</hi> Juſtification. Reade <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. throughout; thence is he call'd the <hi>ſurety of a better Teſtament,</hi> (of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. Indeed what need Chriſt do or ſuffer ought for himſelf? he need not have been made under the Law, he need not have died for his own ſins (being holy and without ſinne) but it was for ours, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered once for ſinnes, the juſt for the unjuſt to bring us unto God, &amp;c.</hi> This was a thing clearly held forth in the ſacrifices of the old Law (which were types of Chriſts ſacrifice) thoſe beaſts then ſlaine, did die in the ſtead of the ſinner himſelf. This compact betwixt the Father and Chriſt is one ground of his righteouſneſſe becoming ours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There's a new <hi>law of grace</hi> then made, and promulgated by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the Goſpel unto ſinners; that all guilty ſinners who ſhall in the ſenſe of their ſin and miſery, being under the condemnation of the Law and wrath of God, make out to this city of refuge, to the horns of this Altar, to the obedience and ſatisfaction of this ſurety; and here plead for mercy, diſclaiming all confidence in any righteouſneſſe in themſelves, they ſhall be pardoned, accepted and juſtified; nay, ſhall be more righteous then if they had kept the Law in their own perſons, ſhall more abundantly pleaſe God, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in Jeſus ſhall be juſtified from all thoſe things the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could not juſtifie him from, Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>He that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16. This Law of grace was enacted by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of heaven, and is publiſhed in the Goſpel; this righteouſneſſe is revealed therein, and freely tendred to all that will receive it, and in thankfulneſſe give up themſelves to honour and ſerve their Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Redeemer from the ſenſe and apprehenſion of this his love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>On mans part,</hi> there muſt be (through the mighty operation of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt accompanying the preaching of the Goſpel) <hi>the obedience of faith</hi> to this Law publiſhed; The ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced of his own ſin and unrighteouſneſſe, and of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and excellency of this righteouſneſſe of his Surety, and the free tenders thereof in the Goſpel, muſt come in (as with a rope about his neck, with <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants) humbly confeſſing his ſinne and unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>accepting of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> heartily as his <hi>Surety</hi> and Redeemer; taking the gift of his righteouſneſſe thankfully, pleading for pardon, juſtification, and life through the ſame, and giving up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thankfulneſſe to love and ſerve his Redeemer. Now theſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:164143:23"/> things being done, it's moſt eaſie to underſtand how this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt may ſo be ours (though not <hi>inherent</hi> in us) that we may be juſtified by the ſame: how common is it amongſt men for the debtor to be diſcharged of his debt, and the bond to be cancelled, upon ſome friends paying the debt for him? yea, may not thus a Malefactour be acquitted of ſome bodily puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, if a friend with the conſent of the Magiſtrate ſhall ſuffer in his ſtead? In the way of juſtification ſinful man is much debaſed, and hath nothing to glory in himſelf; the grace of God is highly magnified (which is Gods great deſigne in the work of mans redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption) by finding out ſuch a way to juſtifie and ſave man; and we have more full aſſurance and conſolation, having now a perfect<note n="*" place="margin">It is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſts perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ſaid in Scripture ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and in reſpect of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of heart, &amp;c. but never in reſpect of any abſolute compleat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in them.</note> compleat righteouſneſſe to preſent before God, which the beſt of men could never have found (as before was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) inherent in them, even after regeneration and converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus for the clearing up of this great doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>From all this that hath been ſaid, it is moſt evident that the Quakers (as they have another Man-Chriſt, then him the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures preach, and another God then the true God, who is one God in three perſons; ſo they) have another Goſpel, then that which was preached by the Apoſtles, and hath been received by the Saints, and therefore are to be accounted accurſed, though they ſhould in outward ſhew and appearance, ſeem Angels from heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>That this doctrine of juſtification is no enemy to Sanctification and holineſſe of life, (as the Papiſts have formerly, and the Quakers do now charge it) ſhall be ſhewed fully in the tenth Section, where we ſhall ſpeak of the doctrine of Sanctification; and prove the Quakers to be ſubverters of the ſame. And thus much for the fifth general charge.</p>

               <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> The Quakers deny the Reſurrection of the body, the laſt judgement, Heaven and Hell.</head>
            <p>IT muſt be here remembred (which was before hinted) that it is not the practiſe of Seducers, ever to deny in down-right words the great and fundamental truths revealed in the Scriptures; but often, whileſt they pretend to own the Scripture expreſſions, they pervert and deny the truths themſelves; this is the moſt likely way to deceive people. Now as this was manifeſt in many other weighty points before named; ſo is it apparent in theſe fundamental do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our faith, the reſurrection of the body, the laſt judgement, heaven and hell. The Quakers have theſe in their mouths frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and will ſpeak of them, but they look upon them, as tranſacted in themſelves, now in a myſtery (ſure it muſt be a <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi>) and hold no other reſurrection, judgement, heaven and hell, but what is now in men. As for the reſurrection of the dead body, they will not deny in words but the <hi>body ſhall riſe,</hi> but if it be asked <hi>what body?</hi> they will reply, the <hi>body is Chriſt</hi> (thus have I been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times anſwered by them) but not <hi>our bodies</hi> of fleſh, bones, &amp;c. <hi>theſe they ſay ſhall never riſe again,</hi> and they ignorantly wreſt that Scripture for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. <hi>Fleſh and blood ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> It is known to moſt in this Town, that they have argued publickly againſt the reſurrection of the dead bodie, when they have been preſent at burials; and therefore I need not adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence to ſhew this is their opinion. And as for the laſt <hi>judgement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nailer</hi> to <hi>F. B.</hi> p. 10.</note> 
               <hi>they have often affirmed Chriſt is now come in his Saints to judge the world,</hi> and therefore they take upon them ſo freely to judge and cenſure all, even ſuch whoſe faces they have never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and they ſcoff at others, that make the day of judgement a thing yet to come, and to be at the laſt day. <hi>James Nailer, love to the loſt,</hi> p. 20. cites that Scripture,<note place="margin">See <hi>Nailer love to the loſt,</hi> p. 44. and 46.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. (where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgement</hi>) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their judging of men now, this is all the judgement they ſpeak of; they own not a judgement after the dead bodies of men are raiſed up again. And for <hi>heaven and hell,</hi> they grant no other then what is <hi>now in men;</hi> and indeed this will neceſſarily follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:164143:24"/> the former opinions, for if the body ſhall never be raiſed, and if the ſoul be no diſtinct being from God, and is after its departure out of the body, to be ſwallowed up into God, and ſo God to be all in all; it's a vain thing to ſpeak of judgement, heaven and hell; thus do theſe wretches pervert theſe great and fundamental do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Scriptures, and whileſt they pretend ſo much light within them, they deny that which the blindeſt Nations in the world have <hi>acknowledged,</hi> for there is no Nation ſo barbarous, but hath beleeved an heaven and hell; a future ſtate of happineſſe or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery after this life is done; as will appeare more fully by and by.</p>
            <p>For the confirmation of the weak in theſe weighty points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, let me adde a few things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our bodies, this being a <hi>fundamental</hi> doctrine of Religion, whereon our hope and comfort doth depend, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. and which hath much influence into an holy life and converſation, <hi>Acts</hi> 24 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. The devil did long ſince ſtir up his inſtruments to undermine the ſame; the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Acts 23.8. <hi>denyed the reſurrection, Angels and Spirits;</hi> and ſome amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.12. ſaid, <hi>There is no reſurrection of the dead; Hymeneus and Philetus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.18. ſaid, <hi>the reſurrection was paſt already, and overthrew the faith of ſome,</hi> even as this generation of men now pretend, its already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and paſt in them, the body or Chriſt is now riſen in them, and hereupon deny the future reſurrection of our dead bodies. But it pleaſed the Lord out of his goodneſſe hereupon to cleare up this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine more fully, ſo that there's no doctrine in all the Scriptures hath a clearer and fuller evidence for it ſelf then this hath: It was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently laid down before in the Old Teſtament in many places. See theſe inſtead of many, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.12. but in the New Teſtament, it's not only poſitively laid down and aſſerted, but proved by many Arguments againſt them that denied it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. <hi>Chriſt</hi> proves it againſt the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences them by an Argument taken from Gods Covenant with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he is their God, in Covenant with them, and not only with their ſouls, but with their bodies alſo; therefore they ſhall riſe again; he proves that ſame reſurrection which was denyed by the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> for he ſilenced them; now it's clear they denied the reſurrection of the body of fleſh, &amp;c. See <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24. other places might have been brought to have proved this truth more directly (whereas this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:164143:24"/> Scripture proves it but by conſequence, though clearly enough) but the <hi>Sadduces</hi> only owning the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſt brings a proof from thence for it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. But more eſpecially the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. doth ſo largely prove this doctrine, that if other Scriptures had been altogether ſilent about it, this one Chapter had been ſufficient confirmation thereof. Let the Reader obſerve there three things that the Apoſtle principally treats of in that chapter. 1. He proves the reſurrection of the dead. 2. He ſhews with what bodies they ſhall ariſe. 3. What ſhall become of them which ſhall be alive at the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">I. He proves the reſurrection of the dead, and he evidences that by ſix arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>From the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 3. to 19. for if there be no reſurrection of the dead; then is Chriſt not riſen, but, ſaith he, Chriſt is riſen, therefore muſt the dead riſe, by vertue of their union with him. Now that Chriſt is riſen, he confirms from the Teſtimony of the Scriptures, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle names not what Scriptures, but it's cleare he intends, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. and ſuch like places; then from thoſe many witneſſes that ſaw him, <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. then from the evil conſequences that would follow, if Chriſt riſe not, the Apoſtles ſhould be falſe witneſſes, and their preaching in vaine; and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> faith ſhould be in vain, they ſhould be yet in their ſinnes; and they that were fallen aſleep ſhould be periſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) He proves the reſurrection of the dead body, becauſe, <hi>if it were not ſo, Chriſtians ſhould be of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> verſe 19.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) He argues that <hi>all enemies muſt be overcome,</hi> therefore death; and if ſo, we muſt riſe again.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) He argues it from <hi>a practiſe amongſt thoſe perſons that denied the reſurrection</hi> (probably the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> thoſe ancient hereticks) who were baptized for the dead, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. and therefore their own practiſe might confute them.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) He argues it from <hi>the dangers and ſufferings of the Saints,</hi> verſe 30, &amp;c. which they would not endure, if there were no reſurrection and reward after death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36.</p>
            <p n="6">(6) <hi>The denying the reſurrection, he ſhews, would lead to all epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme and licentiouſneſs,</hi> then may we ſay, <hi>let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die;</hi> thus he confirms the doctrine of the reſurrection of our dead bodies.</p>
            <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. thing in this Chapter is to ſhew <hi>with what bodies the dead ariſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">II.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:164143:25"/> verſe 35. He anſwers in the following verſes, not with ſuch <hi>vile, weak, corruptible</hi> bodies as now we have, but with <hi>incorruptible, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, glorious, and ſpiritual bodies;</hi> ſo Phil. 3.21. <hi>Our vile bodies ſhall be faſhioned like to the glorious body of Chriſt himſelf;</hi> and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as a reaſon of this change, <hi>ver.</hi> 50. <hi>Fleſh and blood ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdome of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruption.</hi> Where obſerve the Apoſtle doth not overthrow what he before had built; that is, he doth not deny the reſurrection of the dead body, that it ſhall not riſe at all (as theſe deceivers would infer) but it ſhall not riſe in ſuch a vile, corruptible, abject condition, it were not capable of the glory of heaven then.</p>
            <p>That this is the minde of the Apoſtle in theſe words, appeares, in that the Apoſtle doth not contradict himſelf, and deſtroy what he had before built; now having before proved the body ſhall ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he doth not here deny it, only he ſhews it ſhall not ariſe in ſuch an abject and baſe condition as now it is in, but in a more glorious condition, and ſo he fitly anſwers the queſtion propounded, <hi>v.</hi> 35. with what body the dead ſhall ariſe? It being alſo conſiderable, that the word <hi>fleſh</hi> is not in Scripture, always put for the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of mans body, for the ſubſtance conſiſting of fleſh, blood and bones, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for the infirme, weak ſtate and condition of man, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 31, 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. and thus the latter part of the verſe ſhews it is to be taken here, <hi>corruption ſhall not inherit incorruption,</hi> corrupt frail fleſh cannot inherit heaven; it muſt be made a glorious ſpiritual body for its qualities and conditions when it is raiſed up again, that ſo it may be capable of the happineſſe of heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The third thing the Apoſtle doth in this Chapter is, he ſheweth what ſhal become of them that ſhal be <hi>alive at the day of the Lord.</hi> v. 51. they ſhall not <hi>fall aſleep,</hi> but be <hi>changed</hi> or tranſlated into a ſtate of <hi>incorruption and immortality</hi> (as it befell <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> in former times) this alſo confirms the doctrine of the reſurrection, becauſe thoſe bodies that ſhall ſurvive at the laſt day ſhall not be <hi>annihilated</hi> but only <hi>changed.</hi> What clearer Teſtimony can be given to this truth then we have in this one chapter? Many other places might be added as <hi>Acts</hi> 23.6. &amp; 24.15. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. with other more, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> But ſome object this is a thing <hi>impoſſible,</hi> How can the dead body, when conſumed to aſhes, or duſt, and this driven away by the winde, and ſcattered, be raiſed up again, the ſelf-ſame body for ſubſtance, Or when a body ſhall be eaten by wilde beaſt or fiſhes, and they again
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:164143:25"/> eaten by men or by other creatures, and their ſubſtances mingled and confounded; how can theſe ever be diſtinguiſhed, and the ſelfe-ſame body that died be raiſed up again?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> 
               <hi>Anſw. Why ſhould it ſeem a thing incredible to you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead,</hi> Act. 26.8? <hi>Ye erre, becauſe ye know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God,</hi> Matth. 22. Do not you ſee as great things wrought before your eyes daily? Doth not the corne that is ſowne in the ground dye and rot, and then ſpring up afterwards, and yet (Oh fooles!) will ye not believe? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. have not many dead bodies been raiſed up formerly that we have mention of in Scripture, to convince men what God can do? Nay, do not we know that men are able by their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power, when ſeveral mettals are mixed together in one lump, to ſever them ſo as each ſhall be pure and unmixed by it ſelf, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing loſe but the droſſe? And will you then ſay, that the infinitely wiſe and powerful God, cannot do that in our bodies, that ſuch poor worms can do in things below here? Let ſuch vain thoughts be laid aſide, and let faith believe, though reaſon cannot comprehend it.</p>
            <p>Then for the Doctrines of <hi>the laſt Judgment, Heaven, and Hell.</hi> I need not inſiſt ſo much upon the proof of them, they will follow upon what is already ſaid; for granting the reſurrection of the body, it will more eaſily be yielded, there ſhall be rewards and puniſhments to which men ſhall be adjudged in the world to come; <hi>That every man ſhall receive according to what he hath done in his body, whether it be good or evil,</hi> 2 Cor. 15.10. This may appeare one great end why God ſhall raiſe them up again. But ſomething I ſhall ſay to ſtrengthen the weak in theſe things alſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let the light</hi> in all men be but judge (which theſe men ſo much ſpeak of) and it will witneſſe againſt them, that there is a future ſtate of happineſſe or miſery, an heaven or an hell, to which men ſhall be adjudged after this life is ended, according as their works have been here; and that judgement, heaven and hell are not only in this life. There is no Nation in the world (however barbarous) but have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, this the light in them hath taught them. The Heathen Poets have ſpoken of their <hi>Eliſian fields,</hi> and of the <hi>infernal rivers</hi> of hell. <hi>Cicero</hi> the Heathen Orator, and <hi>Lucretius</hi> have made mention of the conflagration of the world and the future judgment; the <hi>Turks</hi> ſpeak of Paradiſe, &amp;c theſe they have ſome dark and groping know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of from the light in them, though no clear diſtinct knowledg. The poor <hi>Indians</hi> that go naked (as theſe Quakers ſometimes have done in their deluſions) they have the notion of theſe things; nor are there only
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:164143:26"/> meer notions in theſe Heathens of theſe things, but they have many terrours and feares of conſcience about them, eſpecially when they have been near unto death: this hath been ſo firmly rooted in them, that nothing could weare it out; men that have lived like Atheiſts, have been overtaken with theſe feares ſometimes. Beſides, they have an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure knowledge of a God, and that this God is a righteous God, and will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, and obſerving it is not well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way here with them that do well, nor doth evill befall the wicked more then others, they hence collect there will be a more equal diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of rewards and puniſhments in the world to come. Adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they have knowledge of the ſouls immortality, for they ſee it doth not depend upon the body now for its acts and operations, but can comprehend things that never came within the outward ſences, can know and underſtand the nature and cauſes of things, can attaine ſome knowledge of God, and ſpirits can enter heaven with contemplation while the body lies groveling here upon earth, &amp;c. and therefore they conclude it doth not depend on the body for its being, but is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and being immortal there is an eſtate of eternal happineſſe or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery for it. How little then do theſe men look to the light within them, while they deny theſe manifeſt truths, how falſe are they to their own principles; <hi>if the light that is in them be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. But let us appeal to the <hi>light of the Scriptures,</hi> and there we have more clear and diſtinct diſcovery of theſe things, then this generall light in all hath yet ever made. For the laſt judgement, read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. where we have the proceſſe thereof ſet down at large by Chriſt, the time when it muſt be is ſhewed, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>When the Sonne of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the Holy Angels with him;</hi> not when Chriſt comes in Spirit to his people, but when he comes as the Son of man in a glorious condition, his Angels attending him; and the perſons then to be judged <hi>are all Nations,</hi> ver. 32. and not only a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall be judged, (as theſe poor wretches, affirming this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be now preſent, take on them to judge here and there a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) for the <hi>living and dead</hi> both muſt be judged then, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and <hi>Angels</hi> as well as men, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. The manner of the judgment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the following part of the Chapter, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world by that Man whom he hath appointed, whereof be hath given aſſurance by raiſing him up from the dead,</hi> that Man-Chriſt, that particular Man that was raiſed up from the dead is to be Judge, not theſe men that pretend to judge now. See alſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:164143:26"/> for this, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. And if you would know when this appointed day is to be, the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for men once to dy, but after this the judgement,</hi> after death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the reſurrection and judgment, it is to be at the ſecond appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt (the Son of man) <hi>in the cloudes of Heaven,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1. 1 Theſſ. 4.16. 2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8. for this laſt and great judgement ſee further, <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. with many other places. And for Heaven and Hell after this life is ended, that neceſſarily followes upon the proof of the laſt judgment, theſe being the places of reward and puniſhment to which men ſhall be adjudged at that great day of the Lord: So that its not requiſite to multiply places for theſe; Only let the Reader (for to confirme his faith) peruſe at his leaſure theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34, 56. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 5, 8. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.26. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.15. From which places its evident, that Heaven is a place of perfect bliſſe and happineſſe, not upon earth, but above the viſible Heavens, not to be enjoyed whil'ſt we be in the fleſh here (though we have ſome foretaſts or earneſts of it, in which reſpect it may be ſaid the Kingdome of Heaven is now within us) but into which the ſouls of the righteous ſhall be tranſlated, preſently after their departure out of the body; and which their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with their ſouls after the reſurrection and laſt judgment ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally poſſeſſe and inherit. And hell is a place of endleſſe and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite torments to which wicked men ſhall be adjudged; into which they are not now actually thruſt whileſt they are upon earth (though they feel flaſhes of wrath upon their conſciences ſometimes which are the earneſts thereof) but after their departure out of the fleſh, their ſoules ſhall be tormented therein; and after the reſurrection of the juſt and of the unjuſt, their bodies ſhall be ſentenced with their ſouls, to be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed therein.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader ſee from hence, what wicked enemies of the truths of Chriſt this generation of men are, that dare thus ſubvert the moſt fundamental truths of the Goſpel, whereon the comfort and hope of Chriſtians depends, and which being overthrown, a gap is opened to all wickedneſſe, and abominations; for what impieties will not men venture upon, when they believe no reſurrection, judgment, heaven, or hell, but what men have now in their conſciences? and what diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement will this be to the Saints, whoſe only comfort and hope ariſes from that inviſible glory in the world to come?

               <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> The Quakers are enemies to all the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THe holy Ordinances of God, being inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the King of his Church, to the end, we might therein viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tender up to God that homage and worſhip that is due unto his Name; and that we might in them enjoy communion with himſelfe; as alſo that through them he might communicate the influences of his grace and bleſſing unto our ſoul: it cannot but be horrid impiety in any to attempt the violation of the ſame. How can it be otherwiſe reputed by any gracious heart, but high treaſon againſt the crown and dignity of our Lord Jeſus, thus to trample upon his inſtitutions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments? and a ſacrilegious robbing of God of that manifeſted glory due to him (which was the great end of his creating the world, and redeeming mankind?) As alſo extreamly prejudicial to the comfort and ſalvation of mens ſouls? Such therefore as ſhall attempt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of the ſame (notwithſtanding what faire pretenſes they may make) cannot be otherwiſe adjudged then the open enemies of God, and the manifeſt confederates of Satan the Prince of darkneſſe for wherein can they gratifie that evil ſpirit more, then in caſting down the holy Ordinances of Gods worſhip and ſervice? This is evident, in that the devil doth enjoyne ſuch as are his ſworn ſervants and ſlaves (that is, witches) ſo ſoon as they be admitted into that curſed ſociety to renounce the Ordinances of God, to deny their baptiſme, to turn their backs off the Miniſtry of the Word, to caſt off prayer to God, &amp;c. as hath been made to appeare by the publike confeſſions of many of theſe miſerable creatures, when they have been condemned to die for their wickedneſſe. If then the Quakers ſhall be found guilty of this crime, to be enemies to all the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, the weakeſt Chriſtian may ſee ground enough to reject them and abhor their ways. This charge I ſhall therefore now make good againſt them, by inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in theſe ſeveral Ordinances of Chriſt which they renounce and caſt off.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the miniſterial teaching and preaching of the word, this is an appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. and to continue to the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. therefore was care taken
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:164143:28"/> that after the Apoſtles there might be a conſtant ſucceſſion of Miniſters in the Churches or Chriſt in after ages, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. But now this Ordinance is denied by the Quakers, they hold forth the <hi>light in them to be a ſufficient teacher, that there needs no other to teach but that, neither the teaching of the Scriptures, nor the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of men.</hi> See <hi>Nailer, Glory ſoon the North,</hi> p. 2, 3. <q rend="inline">All people (ſaith he) ceaſe from their outſide lights, and return to the light of Chriſt in you. — And this light is not a chapter without you in a book, this is the more ſure word of prophecie, &amp;c. <hi>G. F. in a paper to the Baptists,</hi> p. 8. You that look out at Teachers without you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider — you are ſtrangers to that Covenant by which all come to know the Lord, and need not that one teach another. <hi>Parnel, trial of faith,</hi> p. 7. Hearken to that in your conſcience, — thou that art willing to follow this, and be guided by this, ſhalt need no man to teach thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> But it will be ſaid, they have teachers, and teaching among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how can they be judged enemies to this Ordinance then?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> I anſwer, it's true, their principles and practiſes do herein contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict each other; and this no unuſual thing amongſt them to do thus. But I ſhall tell you, what one of their great friends replyed to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, when I charged them with it, ſaith he, <hi>Their teaching is but to take people off from other Teachers, that they may be brought to minde the light in them alone, and then they will ceaſe teaching.</hi> Good Reader, ſee what the deſigne of theſe men is, to bring thee and thy poſterity into the condition poor Indians are in (to have no other teaching) and ſo to leave thee. I hope thou ſeeſt by this what enemies they are to thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>As for Prayer, this is alſo an Ordinance of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer in Church Aſſemblies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 15. ſecret in our cloſets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. private prayer in families <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. ſo for prayer and thankſgiving when we receive Gods creatures, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.45. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.36.</p>
            <p>Now this Ordinance the Quakers are enemies to, as appeares by their practiſes, the chiefeſt of their followers have for a long time diſuſed prayer in their families, when they ariſe or go to bed, though formerly ſome of them have been ſeemingly conſcientious therein; they neglect giving thanks when they receive the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and pray not for a bleſſing on them; falling to, as ſwine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking up to heaven. And for their ſpeakers (though of late
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:164143:29"/> they have uſed it more then in former times, as they have in policy more then in honeſty reformed many other things, that they ſaw were an offence to people, and kept them from following them, yet) they are not true friends to prayer, <hi>Nailer p.</hi> 3. of his <hi>Glory from the North,</hi> mocks ſuch as pray for a ſight of ſin and repentance, ſaying, the light in them would diſcover it, &amp;c. and in many other books of theirs this may be ſeen; and what then ſhould Chriſtians pray for, if they may not pray for grace? beſides when their teachers pray here; it's teſtified by many which have heard them; <hi>They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pray to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> (and what prayer can they make then?) but as if they were in the very perſon of Chriſt, (as indeed they hold God to dwell as eſſentially in them as in the Man Chriſt Jeſus) they uſe ſuch expreſſions as Chriſt himſelfe uſed, <hi>John</hi> 17. not praying to God through Chriſt, but as if <hi>Chriſt (perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inhabiting in them)</hi> did himſelf ſpeak to his Father, and not ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worms as they are; alſo they never ſpeak in the plural number, as if the people ſhould joyn with them; but ever in the <hi>ſingular, I pray thee, I thank thee;</hi> and ſo though they ſhould acquit themſelves of this charge, yet they leave all their followers under it, as being ſuch Heathens as know not God, nor call upon his Name, and ſo liable to that curſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Water-baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> are other ſtanding Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, &amp;c. and theſe are to continue to the end of the world, till all Nations be brought into ſubjection to Chriſt; and then muſt the end come; til Chriſt come again (not in Spirit, for ſo he was already to thoſe to whom theſe things were ſpoken,) but in perſon as the Son of man in his glory, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But theſe pretious Ordinances are utterly caſt off by the Quakers (as their practiſe evidences it; and their books ſpeak it plainly (ſee the paper againſt the baptized people, <hi>p.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) <hi>they own no bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with water, but that of the Spirit alone, no Lords Supper, but feeding on Chriſts fleſh and blood by faith,</hi> when in the mean time they alſo deny Chriſt to have a <hi>real body</hi> of fleſh and blood, though glorified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Singing of Pſalmes</hi> is another Ordinance of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. But this is denied utterly by them, they have written two pamphlets formerly againſt my ſelf for vindicating this Ordinance. Let the Reader know, if they publiſh a hundred of ſuch like anſwers to this Treatiſe as thoſe two againſt my vindication of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:164143:29"/> ſinging; I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to write one line in reply to them, as judging it altogether needleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Church-communion</hi> is another Ordinance of Chriſt, when Chriſtians walk together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, and in all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Jeſus Chriſt, as appears by the Apoſtle planting of Churches in every place where the Goſpel was entertained, and Chriſts owning of them by writing to them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. and this Ordinance was to continue to the end of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. but the Quakers <hi>deny there ever could true Church be found ſince the Apoſtles time to this time. Burr.</hi> againſt <hi>Grif.</hi> pag. 26.</p>
            <p>For <hi>the Lords-day,</hi> it is known they are no friends to it, <hi>they make all days alike,</hi> many have profeſſed againſt it, and the known practiſes of their followers evidence, they make no conſcience thereof, although in the fourth Commandment God requires the keeping ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſeventh day, or <hi>one day in ſeven;</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>He that breaketh one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and teachteh men to do ſo, ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven;</hi> and it's evident the Apoſtles and primitive Saints met together <hi>every firſt day of the week,</hi> and they found the Lord was with them in ſo doing; and in our own Nation God hath ſo bleſſed the faithful obſervation of this day to the encreaſe of piety and godlineſſe, that no Chriſtian can deny it; but now the devil cannot ſubvert this day by games and ſports, which he attempted formerly; he tries if he can do it, by denying it to be an inſtitution of Chriſt. As for <hi>Chriſtian conference,</hi> a duty ſo pleaſing to God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. it appeares they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle friends thereto by their ſitting <hi>mute</hi> when they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I might inſtance in other appointments of God; <hi>inſtructing their families</hi> in the fear of God, teaching them the knowledge of Chriſt, &amp;c. this though ſtrictly enjoyned in the Scriptures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. and commended by the godly examples of many precious Saints recorded in Scripture, as <hi>Abraham, Timothies mother, &amp;c.</hi> yet hath been derided by ſome of them; what can we teach them, (ſay they) God muſt do all, &amp;c. beſides, to this day there are ſome Maſters, who ſuffer their families to do any thing upon the Lords days, either ſleep at home, or walk about the fields, &amp;c ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no more care of their ſouls then if they were to die as beaſts (as indeed they hold as before was ſhewed;) thus do the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers appear evidently to be enemies to all the holy Ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:164143:30"/>
            <p>But becauſe it is a common plea in theſe apoſtatizing times, that all outward Ordinances are aboliſhed, Chriſtians are not bound to worſhip God in them now; they were but for the firſt times of the Goſpel, &amp;c. I ſhall adde a little for the eſtabliſhment of the weak that they may not by the craft of Seducers be brought to caſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It was before proved that theſe Ordinances were inſtituted by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the King of his Church (as we ſhewed in each of them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally) and that with expreſſe intimations of the continuance of them, not only for that preſent age, but for all following times to the end of the world; who then dare to take upon him to abrogate the ſame? <hi>The Laws and Ordinances of men are not aboliſhed, but by the ſame power that firſt enacted them, now what one Word of God can theſe men bring for the repeal of any one Ordinance of the Goſpel? may not they on the like account make the great Commandments of beleeving, repenting, &amp;c. be temporary Commandments, and not concerning Chriſtians in theſe times?</hi> and why ſhould not the other nine Commandments be aboliſhed as well as the fourth, which requires a ſet ſtinted time for Gods ſolemn worſhip and ſervice, even every ſeventh day, or as well as any other outward Ordinance commanded by Jeſus Chriſt in the Word? Certain we are, there be <hi>the ſame grounds and reaſons for continuance of theſe Ordinances of God now, as were at firſt for the inſtitution of them.</hi> Is not God to be viſibly worſhipped and adored by us as well as formerly? and if ſo, it is more fit we ſhould do it in the way of <hi>his appointments,</hi> then in any way of <hi>our own invencieus;</hi> have not we <hi>ſtill need of Ordinances,</hi> wherein to enjoy communion with God? we have no ſuch immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate converſe with God now, as to ſee him face to face, but only as we behold him in the glaſſe of his Ordinances, whileſt we are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> (2 Cor. 5.6.) only while we are waiting on him in his Ordinances he promiſes to meet us and be with us ſpiritually, and we finde many ſweet viſits and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein; we have ſtill need of the communications of his grace and the influences of his Spirit, ſome needing converſion and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, others confirmation and ſtrengthning, all <hi>further increaſings of God,</hi> that we may more and more grow up to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and are not the Ordinances given to us for theſe ends? and not only till <hi>one</hi> come to perfection, but till all (even the whole body of Chriſt) attaine thereunto, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4 10, 11. It's <hi>one great difference betwixt the Ordinances of the Law; and thoſe of the Goſpel,</hi> that the one was to be aboliſhed, but the other to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:164143:30"/> continue, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. indeed legal Ordinances and obſervations were to be done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 21.22. ſuch as touch not, taſte not, handle not; thoſe <hi>carnal Ordinances which ſtood in meats, and drinks, and certaine waſhings, &amp;c. were but till the time of reformation,</hi> till Chriſt came in the fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. but the Goſpel inſtitutions of Chriſt were to continue to the <hi>end of the world,</hi> to the ſecond coming of Chriſt, till all Nations be brought in, and the body of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, as before was ſhewed; and the ſame Apoſtle that ſpeaks ſo much againſt legal Ordinances, yet commends the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Goſpel Ordinances, which he having received from Chriſt, had delivered unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2, 23. Theſe are to continue in the moſt glorious times of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> laſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15, 19. And when God poureth his Spirit on his people more abundantly, it's to help them to walk in the Ordinances and Commandments of Chriſt, not to lead them out of them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>The Ordinances of God are reckoned among the foundations of Religion, Heb.</hi> 6 1, 2. therefore take away them and you pull down all Religion, the building will fall down if the foundation be once removed. But I adde no more, the experience that we have had of the bleſſing of the Lord upon his Ordinances for the convincing, converting, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and comſorting of very many ſouls; as alſo of the malice and rage of Satan againſt them, both in former times of perſecution, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up ſome to corrupt them and ſuppreſſe them, and in theſe preſent times of liberty, ſtirring up others to vilifie and decry them, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirm Chriſtians againſt this temptation of caſting off Gods holy Ordinances. And it is obſervable, that though the devil hath been induſtrious to pull down the Ordinances of Gods worſhip; yet he hath laboured to <hi>arrogate this honour to himſelf;</hi> though he would not have God worſhipped, yet will he have ſolemn worſhip from his confederates <hi>tendred to himſelf;</hi> he hath his ſet weekly times to be worſhipped in, and ſolemn meetings, and aſſemblies of witches to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him; he will have them pray to him, be baptized to the Devil, and take a new name; and he hath his abominable feaſts in imitation of the holy Sacramental feaſts appointed by Chriſt in his Churches, and will oft himſelf make ſet ſpeeches to exhort them unto evil, as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt exhort to holineſſe; this is teſtified by many credible perſons that have been ear-witneſſes of the confeſſions of thoſe curſed creatures, which have been actors in thoſe devilliſh worſhips. Let every one therefore fear to caſt off the holy Ordinances of God, leſt in the juſt judgement of God, he be thus given up to worſhip the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:164143:31"/> devil. And thus for this ſeventh general charge, that the Quakers are enemies to all the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. gave out that <hi>he was ſome great one,</hi> even the mighty power of God. Many wicked hereticks in the primitive times boaſted of great miracles done by them, as <hi>Tertull.

Now that the Quakers may in this, as well as in other things be manifeſt to be Seducers, I ſhall ſhew what claime they make to a power to work miracles. It's true they have not yet publiſhed any volumns of their miracles to the world in print, as the Papiſts have done; and as ſome in <hi>England</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts at <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in Suffolk publiſhed a book called the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſhood of which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by themſelves confeſſed before <hi>Br.

I ſhall relate a few of thoſe pretended miracles, that I have had from ſome of them reported to my ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:164143:31"/>
            <p>One of them (now or lately in priſon at <hi>Bury</hi>) being called to the Miniſtry (ſay they) and queſtioning at firſt, whether his call was from God, deſired a ſigne for the confirmation thereof, that by touching or ſpeaking to a woman, who then lay very ſick, ſhe might be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſtored to health, which doing (ſaith the reporter) ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recovered. Another of them being put into a dungeon, and there kept for ſome days without any meat, became very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, whereupon he was bidden by the voice within him to ariſe and eat, and was directed to a place neer the grate, where were many ugly ſpiders, of which he took and did eate till he was ſatisfied thereby as well as if he had eaten of the wholeſomeſt food in the world. Two others of them being in priſon at <hi>Cheſter</hi> (or ſome other place in the Weſt, for the reporter could not certainly tell me what place) were ſinging of <hi>Pſalmes</hi> together, a thing they ſo highly exclaime againſt others for doing; and ſuddenly ſuch a glorious light ſhone into the priſon, as made the Jaylor to come trembling, and fall down before them, whereupon he and his houſhold were converted to them that day. One in the North, (as it was confidently reported to me by themſelves) did faſt full fourty dayes and fourty nights together, without taking any food. The wife of Coll. <hi>Benſon</hi> (ſaith the ſame reporter) being with child went to <hi>York</hi> upon ſome meſſage from God to oppoſe the Prieſts, where not being known, ſhe was caſt into Priſon, and delivered of a childe there, but before her delivery told thoſe with her, that ſhe ſhould feel no paine in her travel, and ſhould have a man-childe, whoſe name ſhould be <hi>Immanuel,</hi> which child was ſhewed afterward to the Protector for a wonder. Many aged and infirme women (ſay they) ſince they came into this way, out of weakneſſe have become ſtrong and able to travel hundreds of miles on foot.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being objected againſt by me, as being done far of, and moſt of them in corners, and therefore far unlike the miracles done by Chriſt and the Apoſtles I deſired to hear of ſome done neerer hand, the truth of which I might finde out; whereupon I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one in this Town wherein I live, and another at <hi>Norwich.</hi> That in this Town was reported to me (as neer as I can remember) in theſe very words. Was it not a Miracle for <hi>T. C.</hi> that had been brought ſo low by a <hi>Quartane Ague</hi> to be ſo ſuddenly recovered? I anſwered, it was a merciful providence, but no miracle, and further, demanded by what means he was cured? It was replyed, that <hi>Richard Hubberthorne,</hi> did but go to his door and ſpeak to him, and preſently
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:164143:32"/> he recovered; but afterwards enquiring of the man himſelf; what <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorne</hi> ſaid to him; he told me, he ſaid nothing but bade him look to the light in him, he did not rebuke his diſtemper, nor command him in the Name of Chriſt to ariſe and walk; and ſince that time this poore man hath continued in a languiſhing condition.</p>
            <p>That other pretended miracle at <hi>Norwich,</hi> was upon <hi>Thomas Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Weaver; one of their ſpeakers, a letter whereof I read, ſubſcribed with his own hand, It was this, that upon a Lords day (ſome few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths agon) the hand of the Lord was upon him from morning to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very ſore; and he was ſmitten with a tormenting pain in his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and nothing that his friends about him applied could help him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they gave him over as irrecoverable; whereupon the voice within him bade him take a draught of cold water, which he doing in the obedience of faith, his ſpirits revived, and himſelf preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſent out a letter of this to his friends that they might give glory for it to God, and be thereby further confirmed and eſtabliſhed in their way.</p>

Only I have one memorable ſtory to relate about the ſame, which is of <hi>Atkinſon</hi> that notorious impoſtor, when he firſt came to <hi>Norwich,</hi> who pretended (and thoſe poore people did readily believe him,) that the dread of the Lord fell upon him, as he was travelling on his journey, and he was ſmitten off from his horſe (as <hi>Saul</hi> going to <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) and it was told him he was going to as ignorant and blind a City as any was in the world, and there ſhould ſuffer for Chriſt, and be impriſoned, but ſhould have unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comforts, &amp;c. The notorious wickedneſſe of this wretch now diſcovered to all, may convince that it was no hard thing for him to invent ſuch cheats to delude poore creatures by, who are willing to be deceived</p>
            <p>Now leaſt any weak ones ſhould be ſtumbled at theſe pretenſes of Miracles, and be thereby induced to hearken to them, I ſhall adde theſe few things for the ſake of ſuch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If theſe Miracles or wonders which thoſe perſons pretend to work, were indeed true and reall, and not feigned things; yet ſeeing they are wrought to confirme lying doctrines (as the doctrines of the Quakers are before proved to be) we are not to hearken unto them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13., 1:2. <hi>If a Prophet</hi> ſhall <hi>give a ſigne, or wonder, and it come
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:164143:32"/> to paſs, of it be to tempt, to follow ſtrange gods, we are not to hearken to ſuch,</hi> for the Lord permits it to try his people and prove them. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed that in theſe laſt dayes, this power of working Miracles is to be in the hands of falſe prophets and deceivers, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. And therefore faith <hi>Aug.</hi> tract. in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. God hath armed us againſt ſuch Miracle-mongers by warning us, that in the latter daies falſe prophets ſhall work ſignes and wonders, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But how evident is it, they are but lying ſignes and wonders, as the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. calls them, or (as <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaks of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Hereticks in former times) either the juglings or mockeries of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull men, or elſe illuſions of lying ſpirits. For, ſuch as were preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be wrought in theſe parts I ſhewed before thoſe to be no better; and for ſuch, as be pretended to be done in remote parts, we have reaſon enough to ſuſpect them, when we find their deceits at home, beſides it's moſt certain God will never put to his ſeale (of true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which he only can work) to confirme lyes</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The enemies of the truth in former times have wrought greater wonders by far</hi> then theſe people have pretended to; what wonders were wrought by the <hi>Egyptian Sorcerers</hi> in the time of <hi>Moſes?</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the primitive times: but eſpecially how many and how great miracles have been pretended to be wrought by the Papiſts? theſe being ſo eminent, we are prophetically warned of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13, 14. where we read that the <hi>ſecond beaſt,</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> poſſeſſing the ſeat of the <hi>firſt beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> ſhould <hi>do great wonders, and deceive them that dwell upon the earth</hi> by his miracles. And indeed hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any new doctrine that the Papiſts coyned, or ſuperſtitious rites and ceremonies, but that had multitudes of pretended miracles to confirme the ſame. When they would bring into the Church <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or the Doctrine of Chriſts bodily preſence in the Lords Supper, they have pretended their wafer-cakes have been ſeen bleeding as they were broken and eaten by them; and that heathens have come into their aſſemblies and ſeen the Chriſtians put a little pretty boy into their mouthes, &amp;c. When they would bring in the <hi>worſhipping of Images,</hi> they have pretended that thoſe dead ſtocks have moved themſelves, could walk, could ſtirr their eyes and hands, could ſpeak, could light their owne Tapers, could heale the ſick, and raiſe the dead; how many wonderfull cures and miracles have been wrought (as they ſay) by the image of the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> ſome of her chappels have laid up in them very many crutches, pictures of armes leggs, &amp;c. All which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſhe hath miraculouſly healed and recovered; they that will not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:164143:33"/> believe things done beyond ſea; nay, enquire after the great miracles done here amongſt us by the <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Walſingham</hi> and <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> ſtrang things for Images to do; and wherefore were all theſe fained? but to draw people to worſhip Images and pray to Saints: When they would bring in Purgatory, dirges, maſſes for the dead, they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſoules of many departed have appeared to their living friends, made dreadfull complaints to them of their puniſhments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to have ſo many dirges ſaid for them, that they might the ſooner come out of Purgatory; when they would extoll their holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, croſſes, &amp;c. they have pretended devils have been driven away thereby, &amp;c. But there are many volumnes of theſe miracles written by the Papiſts, and are yet defended by them as true, and believed by their blinded followers; and therefore if ſuch miracles will induce any to embrace lying doctrines, then there is far more reaſon to embrace Popery then Quakeriſme.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if any ſhall yet deſire miracles to confirm their faith. Let them know that <hi>we have greater miracles then the Quakers or Papiſts can plead;</hi> For whilſt we hold faſt the Doctrine of Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, all the miracles which they wrought are ours, for they were wrought to confirme the faith which we now profeſſe; nor let any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a continuance of them in all ages, for if they ſhould be ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they would not be eſteemed miracles; who would look upon the <hi>ſtanding ſtill of the Sun in the firmament,</hi> or of the <hi>waters in Jordan, and the red ſea,</hi> as a miracle, if ordinary ſeeing the motion of the Sun, and the ebbing and flowing of the Sea are greater miracles if they were not ſo common? let us therefore confirm our faith from all thoſe former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and not expect lying ſignes and wonders now; Theſe <hi>miracles of Chriſt and the Apoſtles</hi> were indeed <hi>true miracles,</hi> and <hi>beyond the power of any created being to work;</hi> they were <hi>frequently wrought in many places;</hi> and that <hi>not in corners</hi> but <hi>before multitudes,</hi> that the enemies of Chriſt could not then, nor can to this day deny them; and they continued for an age at leaſt to be wrought, and therefore be a ſufficient confirmation of the Doctrine delivered by them; but theſe pretended miracles of the Quakers are but lying ſignes and wonders (as the Scripture ſpeaks) wrought in corners, not acknowledged by any but their ſeduced follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; what folly is it then for any to believe their doctrines upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch miracles? And ſo much for this eighth Section concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pretending to miracles.</p>

               <hi>SECT. IX.</hi> The Quakers are no truly mortified perſons, notwithſtanding their pretences to mortification, and how Popiſh Monks and others have out-ſtripped them therein.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing more apt to deceive weak and ſimple hearted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then the faire ſhews and pretences of mortification and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that ſeducers do ſometime make; for it hath been found that the greateſt impoſtours and deceivers have put on the vizard of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. The Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. that <hi>the falſe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> in thoſe times, <hi>transformed themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and into Miniſters of righteouſneſſe,</hi> even <hi>as Satan himſelf is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angel of light.</hi> The <hi>Scribes and Phariſees</hi> did make ſuch a profeſſion of godlineſſe, as thereby they gained an high eſteem from the common people, who had a ſaying, that if there were but two ſaved, the one ſhould be a Scribe, the other a Phariſee. And (not to ſpeak of the ſeeming piety of ſome Hereticks in the Primitive times) this was moſt notoriouſly ſeen in the <hi>Popiſh Monks and Friars,</hi> who through their ſeeming ſanctity, their voluntary poverty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world; through their great devotion and pretended communion with God, their extreame faſtings, watchings, and mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations of the fleſh; their pretended auſterity and ſtrictneſſe of life, and ſuch like things, had inſinuated themſelves ſo far into the hearts of people, that they had drawn away a great part of the Chriſtian world after them, made them eaſily entertain their wicked doctrines, ſuperſtitions and idolatries, ſubject their conſciences to the Popiſh Anti-chriſt, give away their riches and wealth to them, and many thought they might be ſaved, how ever they lived, if but buryed in a Friars weed. In like manner, we ſee ſome ignorant and well-meaning people apt to be taken with the ſeeming mortification and piety of the Quakers, through their deſpiſing the faſhions of the world, and contemning the honours and pleaſure thereof, their abſtemious uſe of the creatures, and frequent faſting and neglecting of the body, their ſober and auſtear carriage and deportment amongſt men, with their willingneſſe to ſuffer for their way; as alſo their pretenſes of high raptures and enjoyments in a more immediate converſe with God then others have. Now, leaſt the pretenſes of theſe and ſuch
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:164143:34"/> like things ſhould be a temptation to any weak ones to entertain their doctrines, and conceive a good opinion of their wayes; I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſerious conſideration of ſuch, theſe few enſuing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We are not to judge of faith by perſons, but of perſons by faith,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of <hi>Tertullian de praeſc. cont. haer. cap.</hi> 3. for many have been led into errour by the example of ſome whom they have had an high eſteem of; if men ſeem never ſo holy, yea, to be <hi>Angels</hi> from heaven, if they <hi>bring another Goſpel, they are to be held accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8. Satans meſſengers (as before was hinted) may transforme themſelves into Miniſters of righteouſneſs. <hi>Chriſt bade us beware of falſe prophets,</hi> Mat. 7.15. though <hi>they come in ſheeps cloathing,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be holy and harmleſſe, for they may be <hi>ravening wolves,</hi> Rev. 13.11. the <hi>ſecond Beaſt,</hi> or Pope, <hi>had two horns like a Lamb, but ſpake like the dragon,</hi> ſeemed in ſhew and appearance as a Lamb, but his doctrine that came out of his mouth was devilliſh. If therefore the Quakers were truly pious and mortified perſons, this ſhould be no ground to receive their doctrine, but we ſhould go to the Law and to the Teſtimony, and <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> whether the things they ſpeak be ſo or no, but we have before ſhewed from the Scriptures their doctrines are wicked and damnable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But how evident is it to all that will ſee, <hi>that they are no ſuch mortified perſons as they pretend to be;</hi> (I love not to lay open their wickedneſſe, but would leave it to the great day of diſcovery; were I not compelled, becauſe they boaſt, they are perfectly free from the being of ſin, and left their pretences of piety ſhould draw any weak ones to entertaine their doctrines.) Where are there to be found <hi>greater railers upon earth, and revilers of the ſervants of Chriſt,</hi> who are moſt eminent for grace and holineſſe then they? how often do they call them Serpents, Devils, Vipers, Adders, Sorcerers, Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Theeves, Murderers, Witches, with other like expreſſions, which may be ſeen in their books and letters? they far tranſcend herein thoſe perſecuting enemies of the people of God in former times; ſhall ſuch <hi>perſons ever inherit the Kingdome of God?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.10. where can there be found <hi>ſuch intollerable pride</hi> in any upon earth, (except alone in the man of ſin that Romiſh Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2 4.) as is in theſe men? who dare boaſt, <hi>they are equal with God,</hi> that they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, perfectly free from the being of ſin;</hi> who dare write their pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets ordinarily as given from the Lord, from the Spirit of God immediately; that dare ſcorne all others not of their way, and judge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:164143:34"/> them as ungodly, hypocrites, blinde, &amp;c. do theſe things argue holy and mortified perſons? <hi>how full of lying, of falſe accuſing, &amp;c.</hi> are their writings? <hi>what bitter enemies are they to the wayes and ſervants of Chriſt,</hi> and in reproaching and vilifying them, out-ſtrip the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Prelates and their party in former times? who ſeeth not that the devil hath raiſed up theſe to act the part of that wicked crew, who are now brought under the hatches, for their enmity is chiefly, if not only vented againſt the ſame people and ways that were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted formerly by the prelatical party?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> 
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome will ſay they are no drunkards, no adulterers, &amp;c. ſuch ways they hate.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Suppoſe it be ſo, no more is the devil a drunkard, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, adulterer, and yet his ſpiritual wickedneſſes, his pride, malice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, lying, falſe accuſing of the Saints, &amp;c. are no leſſe crimes then drunkenneſſe, gluttony, &amp;c. and in theſe things the Quakers appear as eminently the children of the devil as any do. <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> (as it's reported of him) was a <hi>temperate, juſt and ſtrict man,</hi> but a <hi>moſt wicked enemy of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But for ſuch fleſhly luſts, we have no great experience of their converſations, moſt of them being ſtrangers here, and therefore we cannot ſo well diſcover ſuch things if they were guilty of them; yet for the time they have been in theſe parts, we have ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that they may be guilty of ſuch filthineſſe of the fleſh, as well as of ſuch filthineſſe of ſpirit as was before mentioned. There hath ſcarce been known a more vile wretch then <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> (who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was acknowledged by themſelves, the chiefeſt of their Sect) who after he had profeſſed repentance for his filthineſſe and leudneſſe comitted with the woman, he hath ſince married; yet eſcaping out of priſon, he practiſed greater villany then before, for being at an Inne called the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Thurton,</hi> within five or ſix miles of <hi>Norwich</hi> (as I was informed by two credible perſons, who were occaſionally at the ſame Inne at that time) he there offered ten ſhillings in hire of an whore, and fell in love with a young girle, whom he ſuited ſo as he did cry and whine for her, he told ſuch lies concerning himſelf, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhewed himſelf ſo vile, that it was apparent he was no novice in ſuch actions, for no man on a ſudden arrives to the height of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe: I might annex the ſtory of thoſe two Quakers ſpoken of in the book put forth by <hi>Gilpin,</hi> and of him that being condemned to die for inceſt in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> poiſoned himſelf in priſon. But theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done in more remote parts I ſhall not inſiſt upon them; Now let
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:164143:35"/> not any ſay, it's a common thing for ſome wicked perſons to be found amongſt ſuch as are moſt holy, and therefore theſe few examples ſhould not condemn the reſt of them; for they are men that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be perfectly free from the being of ſin, to be infallible, &amp;c. and therefore the fall any one ſhews their doctrine to be lies; beſides, what ſpiritual wickedneſſes reigns amongſt them generally, was ſhewed before, and they are not aſhamed to defend ſuch actions as tend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to lead men to ſuch filthineſſe, as going naked, &amp;c. How clear is it then from all this that theſe people are no truly mortified perſons what ever they pretend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That mortification which they profeſſe to have, conſiſts but in ſome external things, which God never required, as voluntary humility, neglecting of the body,</hi> (which things are called <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> Col. 2.) in putting away outward ornaments, not wearing ribbons, refuſing titles of honour, to be called Maſter, not putting off the hat, uſing the words of yea, nay, thou; in their wilful ſufferings for oppoſing and vilifying Miniſters, in much faſting, and abſtemious uſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c. Now as for theſe it may be ſaid, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at their hands?</hi> What are thoſe when they are enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt and to the righteouſneſſe of faith (as was ſhewed in the Section of Juſtification) when they place righteouſneſſe in ſuch obſervations, not knowing the mortification of the corruptions of the heart, as was before proved; when they are ignorant of, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to an inward and ſpiritual work of grace and regeneration upon the heart, as ſhall be made to appear in the next Section; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, how eaſie is it for any carnal heart to learn ſuch outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and place their righteouſneſſe in them; and yet even in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals they ſin againſt their own principle of the light in them, as by wearing ſuch ruffian-like long haire; ſo <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Duesbury,</hi> two great and principal men amongſt them have done, that light in them might teach them <hi>its a ſhame to do ſo,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And <hi>even in theſe external ſhews of mortification they been have far out-ſtripped</hi> by many others; the <hi>Phariſees of old</hi> (ſee <hi>Montagu</hi> Acts and Monuments of the Church, <hi>cap.</hi> 7.) have ſometimes made vows of continence, abſtinence, watching and praying for ten years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, during all which time, they would not come near any beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful woman, and when neceſſity compelled them to ſleep, they would lie upon narrow planks, or upon ſtones, or thorns, that they might ſooner be awakened to prayer, reading, and meditation; they pretended revelations and inſpirations; their ordinary faſtings were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:164143:35"/> two dayes in the week, the third and fifth dayes, wherein the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſtained from meat till the ſtars appeared; but in their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary faſts they uſed greater ſeverity over the fleſh; they would ſhew great auſterity in their common deportment, and would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their lives before they would recede from their way. The <hi>Eſſens</hi> (another Sect amongſt the Jews) did yet go beyond the Phariſees, ſhewing a wonderful gravity and auſterity in their carriages, deteſting not only prophanneſſe, but lawful pleaſures and delights, abſtinence, continence, and maſtering their affections they eſteemed a chief point of piety; for marriage, they cared not for it, nor for the company of women; getting of wealth, and growing rich they deſpiſed; to ſwear any oath was a capital crime; they were ſo addicted to contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſome of them did not eat in three dayes time, ſome in ſix; when they did eat, brown bread and ſalt was their ordinary food, and when they exceeded, they had green hearbs; their apparel was poor and ſimple, only to preſerve from cold and heat; they turned the Scriptures into allegories (as the Quakers do) following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Egyptian wiſe men,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philo;</hi> they pretended to revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and prophetical inſpirations; maintained community of goods; torments of body they regard not, but endured with courage and conſtancy; when they enter upon their way firſt, they profeſſe to love and ſerve God truly and above all, to live juſtly and uprightly with men, &amp;c. and yet they profeſt not faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports) they worſhipped the Sun. But eſpecially, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others the <hi>Popiſh Monks, Friars and Hermites</hi> have excelled in theſe outward obſervances, ſome of them profeſſing poverty, have given away all they had, &amp; lived by begging; ſome go bare-foot, and are badly clad; ſome live in the wilderneſſe in caves and hutts from the ſociety of men, caſting off worldly imployments and tentations, and giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only to their devotion, prayer, watching, and contemplation, the like do others in cloyſters; for their abſtinence from creature comforts, their continency, and their extraordinary faſtings, and exceeding poor diet many have been famous; ſome have macerated their bodies, and killed themſelves therewith; what cruel whippings of their bodies for bringing the fleſh into ſubjection have they uſed? ſome have put ſpurs betwixt their skin and their garments, and have lien upon ſharp chips; glorious viſions and raptures alſo ſome have pretended to, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate communion with God and with Angels; for ſufferings they have endured much; the Jeſuites boaſt that of their ſociety and order alone in a few years three hundred have ſuffered Martyrdome; ſome that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:164143:36"/> might have eſcaped death, have voluntarily offered themſelves thereto (as ſometimes the Circumcelliones amongſt the Donatiſts) volumnes have beeen written of theſe things, and no wonder they place righteouſneſſe in theſe things, and ſeek juſtification thereby. Now how far do all theſe excel the Quakers in external ſhews of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in voluntary humility, and neglecting of the body? for apparrel, the Quakers go as neat and trim as moſt Yeomen in the Country, though they came hither firſt in very mean and poor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire moſt of them; for diet and lodging they have had as good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; for their ſufferings they are not comparable with thoſe before named; for worldly profits it's obſerved their followers do as little contemne the ſame as moſt others. Now, by all that hath been ſaid, it may appear, there is but little reaſon for any to be induced to think well of the Quakers way, becauſe of their pretences to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and holineſſe. And thus for the ninth Section.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>SECT. X.</hi> The Quakers doctrine tendeth not to destroy ſinne, although they raile againſt ſinne; and how they deſtroy the true doctrine of Sanctification.</head>
            <p>I finde by experience that one great temptation, that induceth weak and ungrounded people to retain ſome good opinion of the Quakers, is, becauſe they ſpeak againſt ſin vehemently, condemning pride, covetouſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. can theſe men be ſo bad (ſay they) and ſuch enemies of Chriſt, when they write and ſpeak ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things, and cry out ſo much againſt ſin? Theſe people who thus argue, are little acquainted with the <hi>ſubtilties of Satan, who can transform himſelf into an Angel of light;</hi> and with the craftineſs of ſeducers, who can <hi>pretend themſelves Miniſters of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.13, 14, 15. that they may the rather deceive. If Satan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments ſhould appear ever in their colours, as enemies of Chriſt and holineſſe, who would be deceived by them?</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore in the next place (for the ſake of ſuch) ſhew how little theſe mens doctrine conduces to the deſtruction of ſin, and how they ſubvert the true doctrine of Sanctification. This will appear in the enſuing particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They deny the <hi>efficient cauſe of a principle of Sanctification,</hi> to wit,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:164143:36"/> the <hi>Spirit of grace and regeneration,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.13. Rom. 15.16. Tit. 3.5. which is given to the people of God alone, and not to all men in the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>Jude</hi> 19. and (with the Papiſts and Pelagians, thoſe enemies of ſpecial grace; and advancers of the power and ability in man) they make a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon light</hi> or principle put into all men in the world ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſanctification, if men heed the ſame. This is clear from all their writings. See <hi>Nailer, Glory from the North,</hi> p. 2, 3. where he bids people mind the light in their conſciences, and it will lead them to perfect day (fooliſhly pretending this to be that the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. bade them <hi>take heed unto</hi>) this (ſaith he) will <hi>ſhew you all your ſins, and bring you out of them, bring you to repentance, and lead you to juſtification, peace, &amp;c.</hi> and he ſcoffs at thoſe that pray for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light or grace, ſaying, this being minded and heeded is ſufficient, &amp;c. See <hi>Trial of faith,</hi> p. 6, 7. where they affirm, <hi>that light in the conſcience, that all men have, will lead men to repentance, and newneſſe of life;</hi> and if heeded, will crucifie their luſts, and bring them out of the pathes of death into the way of life, &amp;c. If this be ſo, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is there then of faith in Chriſts blood for Juſtification and life? what need of a work of regeneration, and the ſending the Spirit of Chriſt into our hearts for our Sanctification? it was before ſhewed all men have not the Spirit of Chriſt in them; but theſe men neither regard the blood of Chriſt for Juſtification, nor the Spirit of Chriſt for Sanctification, as is evident from their words before cited. But now becauſe we are fallen upon their great and principal doctrine, the ſufficiency of the light in the conſcience to lead men to Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sanctification and Salvation; (for the ſumme of all they hold forth may be reduced to this, <hi>Look to the light within you.</hi>) I ſhall a little diſcuſſe that point, what the light that all men have in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is, and whether it being heeded, is alone available to juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sanctification and Salvation. I ſhall ſpeak to this great queſtion clearly and fully in theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There is a light which God hath enlightned every man in the world withal,</hi> even the light of underſtanding and reaſon wherby man is diſtinguiſhed from the beaſts &amp; irrational creatures; and this light may be called the light of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe coming from him as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and thus may the light of the Sun be called the light of Chriſt, for he made it; and the life of beaſts be called the life of Chriſt, for he gave it to them; but what is this to that ſanctified ſaving light and life communicated from Jeſus Chriſt to his people as their Head and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:164143:37"/> Redeemer in their regeneration, to fit them for enjoyment of God, and communion with him in glory? it is of this common light of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (which Chriſt as Creator gives to all men) that that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. ſpeaks of; for in <hi>v.</hi> 10. mention is made of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the world was made by him, and the ſcope of the Evangeliſt in that place is to prove Chriſt to be God (which the Hereticks of thoſe times denied) and what fitter argument to prove it, then his creating the world, and giving life to the creatures, and light of reaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man? Now, this light of reaſon, though it be an excellent gift of Chriſt, for by it man excels other creatures, yet to diſtinguiſh it from that ſpecial illumination of Gods Spirit in converſion and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we call it the light of nature, (gifts of nature as well as of grace, being from God and in themſelves good.) And the Scriptures give the ſame name unto it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. that light in men that condemns long hair, is called nature; and that light and power whereby the Gentiles (who had not the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) did the things contained therein, is called nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. how vainly then do theſe men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil againſt us, for calling this the light of nature, ſeeing the Scriptures ſtile it ſo as well as we?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>This common light of underſtanding and reaſon with which all men in the world be endued</hi> (called the light of nature, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural with man) <hi>is not ſufficient to enlighten men unto converſion and ſalvation, unleſs an higher and ſupernatural light be communicated to them;</hi> this hath been formerly maintained againſt Papiſts and Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the enemies of Gods grace; and I maintain it againſt the Quakers by theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Conſtant experience ſhews it evidently amongſt thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who have had no other light but that in the conſcience, and wanted the preaching of the Goſpel and ſaving illumination of Gods Spirit; not one amongſt them was ever known by that light in them, to have attained to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt (without which there is no ſalvation,) the very Name of Chriſt they have been ignorant of, much more ignorant of the myſteries of his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, death, ſatisfaction, of the new Covenant founded in his blood, &amp;c. but they have worſhipped falſe gods, devils, &amp;c. how then is this light ſufficient which never ſufficeth to convert and ſave any one to this day?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) The Scriptures ſhew in many places the miſerable condition of ſuch people as have not the preaching of the Goſpel amongſt them, they are <hi>in darkneſſe</hi> and the <hi>ſhadow of death,</hi> Mat. 4.16. under the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:164143:37"/> 
               <hi>power of Satan,</hi> Act. 26.18. <hi>without God, without Chriſt, without Hope,</hi> Eph. 2.11. and they cannot <hi>beleeve in Christ without hearing of him by a preacher ſent,</hi> Rom. 10.16. Sure then the heeding of the light in the conſcience was not ſufficient to their Sanctification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Let it be conſidered what knowledge in the things of God men may attain by the light in their conſciences, and what they cannot attain without an higher light, and hereby the inſufficiency of this light will plainly appear. The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. ſhews that there is a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the heathens; that want the preaching of the Goſpel; ſomething of God they may know, from an impreſſion upon their hearts, remaining after the fall; When an enemy demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes a City, ſome foundations of houſes remain; ſo ſome relicks of knowledge and principles of good remain in man after the ruines of Gods image in him, and he may improve this knowledge further by the works of God which are ſeen, and may know there is a God, that this God is a powerful, wiſe, holy, merciful, juſt God; that he is to be worſhipped, feared, loved, and ſerved by man; that groſſe ſins are not to be committed; ſo far may this light in every man guide him, as appears in the very Heathens who had no other helps but this common light; but alas this is far off from bringing men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and ſalvation; this knowledge of God is but dark groping knowledge, they had no clear diſtinct knowledge of God, to know him One in three, could not diſcern the leaſt knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, dying, riſing again, &amp;c. nor of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of the benefits obtained by his blood; could not know the Ordinances of Gods worſhip inſtituted by him, nor the duty of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt for ſalvation; and for ſinne, they could not diſcerne concupiſcence to be ſin by the light in them, but only by the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. how inſufficient then is the light in the conſcience to lead men unto converſion and ſalvation?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> 
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the Quakers have objected to me, if they heed this light, God will give them further; for, <hi>to him that hath ſhall be given, Mat.</hi> 25.29.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is an Objection borrowed from the Papiſts and other enemies of Gods grace, who have frequently perverted this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to overthrow ſpecial grace in converſion; and therefore the anſwer that hath been given to them may ſerve the Quakers. That promiſe of Chriſt there made to the improvement of our talents doth not ſpeak of an increaſe in another kinde, but in the ſame kinde of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:164143:38"/> gifts which we improve, he that ſhall improve Miniſterial gifts (of which Chriſt there ſpeaks) ſhall have further Miniſterial gifts given to him, not that he which improves common and general gifts, ſhall have ſaving converting grace given to him; the contrary we ſee by manifeſt experience in thoſe Heathens who have improved beſt that common talent in ſearching after the knowledge of God, and following moral vertues, God hath left them wholly without the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and hath called ſome more prophane and barbarous; therefore the Scriptures attribute mens effectual calling, and converſion to Gods free grace, and good pleaſure, not to mans improvement of a common talent given to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this objection is grounded upon another rotten Romiſh doctrine, to wit, that men before converſion and regeneration have power to improve the common light and grace they have, ſo as to obtaine of God ſpecial and ſaving grace; a doctrine as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Scriptures, and derogatory to Gods grace as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) It is clear this light in all men is not ſufficient to lead men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, becauſe thoſe that have been moſt zealous followers thereof, have been lead thereby further from God and the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; they have indeed been ſomething eminent in morality and civil converſation, but further off from Chriſtianity then others; <hi>Saul</hi> before his converſion, following it, was blameleſſe in a moral conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but a bitter enemy to Chriſt; this light leads ſome to think they do God good ſervice in perſecuting his ſervants; and how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſome have been deluded, that leaving the light of the Scriptures, have heeded this light in them, appears ſufficiently by the relations of <hi>Gilpin, Toldervy</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we therefore maintain (beſides the common light that God hath given to all) a neceſſity of ſpecial illumination by the Word and Spirit of God unto converſion and ſalvation; Chriſt teaches us, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>Except we be regenerate and borne again, we cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> therefore, ſure what we have at the firſt birth, as we come into the world, ſuffices not, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Chriſt ſends Paul to open the eyes of the blind, and turn men from Satan to God by his preaching,</hi> what need that, if they had before a light in them ſufficient to ſalvation, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119. <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the wonderful things of thy Law, give me underſtanding that I may keep thy precepts,</hi> would not the Quakers correct <hi>David</hi> here,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:164143:38"/> and ſay, why <hi>David!</hi> look to the light within thee, and that is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, what needeſt thou pray for more? ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 1.17, 18. prays for a <hi>Spirit of wiſdom and revelation</hi> for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> though they had already the light in them, and the outward preaching of the Goſpel; our doctrine therefore is more agreeable to the Scriptures then the Quakers doctrine; we teach, beſides the light in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which condemns groſſe ſins (which we would not have men ſin againſt, but to ſtudy to keep a good conſcience void of offence) there is a neceſſity of the light of the Scriptures, and the preaching of the Word to diſcover ſuch things as the conſcience cannot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and of the ſanctifying illumination of Gods Spirit alſo to open our blind eyes to ſee thoſe diſcoveries, and his grace to heal the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our hearts that we may cloſe with them, did the Quakers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the converſion and ſanctification of the ſoul to be ſuch a great work as we do, they would ſee a neceſſity of an higher principle to produce it, then this common light in all men. Reader, thou mayſt ſufficiently ſee what corrupters of the truth the Quakers be, ſeeing in this main doctrine (which is the ſum of all their teaching) they erre ſo groſly, and are plain Papiſts and Pelagians.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Quakers deſtroy the true doctrine of Sanctification,</hi> in that they make it to conſiſt in a few outward obſervances, of caſting off ribbons, not putting off the hat, vſing the expreſſions of thou, yea, nay, &amp;c. (as the Phariſees formerly placed holineſſe in waſhing cups, hands, &amp;c. and the furtheſt they go is but to cry down groſſe ſinnes, as pride, drunkenneſſe, covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. whileſt in the mean time they ſpeak nothing of a work of regeneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation in the heart (for they teach there's enough in men as they come into the world, if they heed that;) and as concerning inward mortification of the ſeeds of evil in the heart, and a ſpiritual work of God upon the ſoul in turning the whole frame of it to God to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in him again; how ſilent are they in theſe great things? did they look upon theſe as neceſſary, they durſt not proudly boaſt they are perfect, and abſolutely free from the being of ſin; but even as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who ſay they are free from the being of ſin, and for that end deny concupiſcence in the regenerate to be ſin; ſo muſt the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers look upon theſe things as nothing, if they will defend their perfection. But we on the contrary maintain the great work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication begins chiefly in the heart, in creating a new heart, infuſing a new ſpirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. (which men have not as they come into the world at the firſt birth, but at the ſecond birth) in making the tree good, and then the fruit will be good afterwards, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.33.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:164143:39"/>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>They deſtroy the proper end of Sanctification;</hi> the end of God in Sanctifying his people is not, that by ſetting up a righteouſneſſe in them, they might thereby be juſtified before God (for their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſtands in Gods free remitting of their ſins, and imputing to them the obedience and ſatisfaction of Chriſt their Surety, wrought in his perſon for them, as was before ſhewed in the Section of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) but that being reconciled to God through Chriſt, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being ſanctified, and the image of God repaired in them, they might be fit to glorifie God, and to enjoy communion with him for ever, to make them fit for glory; for, <hi>without holineſſe no man can ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. But now the Quakers make the great end of God in ſanctifying his people and infuſing righteouſneſſe into them to be, that they might be juſtified before God; and therefore ignorantly confound juſtification, mortification, and ſanctification together; (ſee <hi>Nailer; love to the loſt,</hi> p. 50.) thus are they enemies to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt crucified, and juſtification by faith; they are fallen from grace, and ſeek to lead men from Chriſt to the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>They own not any for truly ſanctified perſons, but ſuch as are perfectly freed from the being of ſinne,</hi> and therefore reproach us, (who ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Romans</hi> 7. we have ſin dwelling in us) as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified perſons, whereas the Scriptures own ſuch for Saints as are freed from the dominion of ſinne, though not yet from the being thereof, and ſhew that in the beſt there is fleſh as well as Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>They deny the grace of God infuſed into the Saints in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to be a created thing</hi> (though the Scripture calls it the <hi>new creature,</hi> 2 Corinth. 5.17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.) and <hi>hold it to be the uncreated being of God</hi> (ſo <hi>Richard Hubberthorne,</hi> and <hi>John Lawrence</hi> in a letter ſent to me, ſpeak) a moſt wretched and blaſphemous doctrine; for then ſhould we be Gods, if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created being were communicated to us; even as Chriſt was God, the divine eſſence being eternally communicated to him; beſides, this doctrine would make us meerly paſſive, as ſtocks and ſtones in all duties of Sanctification, the plain doctrine of the Libertines, that being followed, overthrows all holineſſe; having ſometimes laid open the odiouſneſſe of this opinion to my people, the perſon laſt named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed of it, did openly deny it before the Congregation, but hath now owned it, with his hand ſubſcribing to it.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:164143:39"/>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>They take away many great arguments inducing to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and Sanctification,</hi> as the doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection, laſt Judgement, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell, &amp;c.</hi> as was before ſhewed; now to what purpoſe is it to raile againſt ſinne, when they take away thoſe weapons that ſhould deſtroy it? and to ſpeak of holineſſe, when they take away the greateſt inducements thereunto? <hi>If the dead riſe not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.22. then <hi>let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die;</hi> what need men be affrighted with the ſcar-crowes of Heaven, Hell, &amp;c? Theſe evil words will more corrupt good manners, then all their other good words will promote holineſſe.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>They deſtroy all thoſe helps to Sanctification and Godlineſſe, which God hath given us;</hi> They deny the Ordinances of God (as before was ſhewed) which are the means of grace and Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18, &amp;c. could the prelatical e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of holineſſe in former times take a more crafty courſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe holineſſe, then by ſilencing of Preaching, Catechiſing, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reſtraining Chriſtian communion, &amp;c? how gladly the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers would promote all this if they could, and leave people only to the light in them (which is meer darkneſſe) I ſhewed before in the Section about Ordinances.</p>
            <p>By this time the weakeſt Reader may perceive the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to be but faint enemies to ſinne, though they ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and give bigge words againſt it; and but feigned friends to holineſſe whatever they pretend. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, is ſaid to have ſmitten one of his ſouldiers on the face for railing againſt his enemy; ſaying to him, I hired thee to fight, and not to raile againſt him; as little thanks may theſe men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive from the Lord Jeſus another day, what ever friendſhip they pretend to him now, and what ever enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne they profeſſe, ſeeing they do but build the things they would ſeem to deſtroy. And thus for the tenth general charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Quakers.</p>

               <hi>SECT. XI.</hi> The Quakers ſhewed to be the common ſink of all the Hereſies of our times, and a parallel betwixt them and former Hereticks.</head>
            <p>IT hath been obſerved, that after the Chriſtian world had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted for a long time together with multitudes of curſed errours and hereſies; at length, Popery prevailing in the Weſt and North, and Mahumetaniſme in the Eaſt and South, they were all ſwallowed up in theſe two, as in two great gulfes or common ſewers of all that filthy puddle of falſe doctrine. See <hi>Danaeus de hereſ. cap.</hi> 95, 96. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we find amongſt our ſelves, that thoſe filthy and abominable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that have ſprung up in theſe late years of tolleration ſo plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do moſt of them center in Quakeriſm, and this is become the common ſink of them all. And indeed there are very few, if any at all, (beſides ſome groſly ignorant perſons that have not made any profeſſion of godlineſſe) who are now lead away by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but ſuch as have formerly apoſtatized from the truth, and been infected with the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Anabaptiſme, or Antinomianiſme, Arminianiſme, or Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Familiſme, or Libertiniſme, &amp;c. So that this Serpent of <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriſme</hi> hath threatned to devour up all theſe other Serpents, and ſo to become the Dragon that perſecutes the Churches in theſe Nations. Now, how juſtly may this render the way of <hi>Quakeriſme</hi> ſuſpected to the weakeſt and moſt ſimple of all, in that thoſe that follow it have long ſince left the way of truth, and been unſtable, running after every new way of errour, and ſcarſe any one that hath been accounted a knowing and ſtable Chriſtian doth follow after them?</p>
            <p>It will not be unprofitable if I here annex a ſhort parallel betwixt the Quakers and ſome wicked Hereticks in former times; for hereby it may appeare, that their doctrines are not ſuch new and glorious truths as they would pretend them to be; but old and accurſed hereſies, newly raked out of hell, and the very ſmoake of the bottomeleſſe pit: If the reader ſhall ſee ſo much agreement betwixt them and the vileſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the truth that have been in former times, he will be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereby ther's little reaſon any ſhould be taken with Quakeriſme; I ſhall begin with ſome of thoſe Hereticks ſpoken of in Scripture, and ſhew what agreement is betwixt the Quakers and them.</p>
            <p>One would think the Quakers ſhould not be guilty of any great
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:164143:40"/> complyance with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſeeing they ſo much reproach others with the nick-name of <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but alack this is but ſuch a trick as he playd, that called his honeſt neighbour theife firſt, that his neighbours accuſation againſt him might not be credited: there are many things wherein the Phariſees and Quakers notably agree.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phariſees were bitter enemies of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and conſpired to deſtroy him; and no leſſe enemies to him are the Quakers, they quite annihilate and deſtroy (as much as in them lyeth) his manhood. For they deny that he hath an humane created ſoul (ſo <hi>Richard Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne</hi> expreſly in a letter ſent to my ſelf) and can he be a man that hath not an humane ſoul? and no better do they deal with his body, for that they make never to have riſen from the dead, as was before ſhewed; indeed ſometimes they will ſay he aroſe from the grave (as <hi>Hubberthorne</hi> in the letter aforeſaid, ſaith) but in the next words he ſhewes it was in the ſame perſon in which he was when the world was made: it ſeems this is all the Man-Chriſt they now own. Further, <hi>the Phariſees were zealous for the righteouſneſſe of the Law, but enemies to the Doctrine of Juſtification by faith:</hi> So the Quakers, as was ſhewed before in the Section of Juſtification. <hi>The Phariſees placed all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in outward obſervances:</hi> So the Quakers as was before ſhewed. <hi>The Phariſees pretended much ſeeming ſanctity,</hi> gravity, auſterity, when inwardly full of wickedneſſe: So the Quakers would ſeem holy, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere, but are full of railing and bitterneſſe. <hi>The Phariſees stood much on trivial things, mint, commine, and annice;</hi> So the Quakers, upon cloaths, hats, thou, yea, nay, &amp;c. <hi>The Phariſees truſted on their owne righteouſneſſe, and deſpiſed others:</hi> So the Quakers would be accounted the only holy perſons, and call others Dogges, Swine, Devils. <hi>The Phariſees uſed much ſeverity over their bodies,</hi> abſtinence, faſting, which God commanded not: So the Quakers. <hi>The Phariſees would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed extraordinary for holineſſe,</hi> and have their ſayings received for Oracles: So the Quakers ſay they are perfect, and what they ſpeak or write all is infallible and muſt not be queſtioned. <hi>The Phariſees were horrible corrupters of the Scriptures,</hi> Matth. 5. So the Quakers, as hath been ſhewed. <hi>The Phariſees were raſh cenſurers of others,</hi> John 7.19. &amp; 10.20. Mat. 11.19. So the Quakers. <hi>The Phariſees would compaſſe ſea and land to make a Proſelite,</hi> whereby he became twofold a child of hell more then before: So the Quakers, what an (exact harmony is here twixt theſe two ſects?</p>
            <p>We read in Scripture of another Sect called <hi>Sadduces;</hi> and with them alſo the Quakers have ſome agreement. <hi>Theſe pretend to righteouſneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:164143:41"/> taking their name from <hi>Sedek</hi> (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhews) which ſignifies juſt; So the Quakers pretend hereunto. <hi>The Sadduces deny the Reſurrection of the body,</hi> Mat. 22.23. Act. 23.8. So the Quakers: Herein alſo they agree with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> who made it paſt already, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſpiritually in men here, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. <hi>The Sadduces denied Heaven and Hell,</hi> rewards and puniſhments in the world to come, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports: So the Quakers, as was before proved. <hi>The Sadduces denied Angels and Spirits:</hi> The Quakers, deny the ſpirit or ſoul of man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from God; for <hi>Hubberthorne</hi> againſt <hi>Sherl</hi> ſaith, the Scriptures ſpeak not of an humane ſoul. Were it neceſſary I could ſhew their agreement with many ancient Hereticks in the ages ſucceeded the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, they agree with the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Eunomians</hi> in denying Chriſt to have an humane ſoul; with the <hi>Manichees</hi> in making the ſoul in a man a part of the being of God. With <hi>Adamites</hi> in going naked. With <hi>Antitrinitarians, Jews and Turks</hi> in denying the Trinity; (yet the <hi>Turks,</hi> though they deny the Trinity, do own the Man Jeſus Chriſt more then they, for in their <hi>Alkoran,</hi> they ſay he is a great Prophet, and ſhall come to judge the world at the laſt day, and therefore are better Chriſtians then the Quakers.) They agree with <hi>Pelagians</hi> in their conceit of the ſufficiency of the common grace given to all men: With <hi>Socinians</hi> in ſlighting Chriſts ſatisfaction, and denying it to be our righteouſneſſe before God, and in making Chriſt a figure: With the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in denying the lawfulneſſe of oathes, and of Infant-baptiſme: With the <hi>Familiſts</hi> in turning all the Doctrines of our faith into Allegories, and making Chriſts incarnation, death, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. only myſteries to be witneſſed in men: They agree with the <hi>Libertines</hi> in denying created graces in the Saints, and making Chriſt in a man do all whil'ſt we are paſſive. And with the <hi>Ranters</hi> who make reaſon to be God; for the Quakers make the light in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be Chriſt himſelfe; I have charged them with it as their tenet, and told them, I would report that they held it, if they would not deny it, but they durſt not deny the ſame. I ſhould have done raking in this filthy puddle of falſe doctrine, but that I muſt not omit to parallel them with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they are ſo ready to exclaime againſt others as Popiſh and Anti-chriſtian, whereas none are more deeply guilty of the charge then themſelves. I ſhall ſhew in twenty particulars (and I might inſtance in more) that they exactly agree with them. <hi>The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts deny the neceſſity of the Scriptures;</hi> So the Quakers, I ſhewed both in the firſt Section; <hi>The Papiſts will not have them a rule of faith and life, a judge of controverſies:</hi> So the Quakers; <hi>The Papiſts revile
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:164143:41"/> them and call them a dead letter;</hi> So the Quakers; <hi>The Papiſts equall other things with the Scriptures,</hi> and ſo do the Quakers, the <hi>Papiſts prefer the vulgar tranſlation,</hi> before the original copies of Greek and Hebrew, ſo the Quakers. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> agree with the Quakers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the <hi>great Doctrine of Juſtification;</hi> both make Gods juſtifying act to ſtand in infuſing or putting in righteouſneſſe into men; both hold they are free from the being of ſinne; that they can keep the Law perfectly; both ſcoffe at Proteſtants (who confeſſe they have ſinne dwelling in them, and they need the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to cover them) ſaying, they make Chriſts righteouſneſſe a cover to their abominations. <hi>The Papiſts place holineſs in outward obſervations, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary humility, neglecting of the body,</hi> caſting off wordly imployments; So the Quakers. The <hi>Papiſts take away juſtification by faith,</hi> turne from the Goſpel to the Law, are fallen from grace, ſo the Quakers. The <hi>Papiſts pretend revelations, viſions, raptures, trances,</hi> ſo the Quakers. The <hi>Papiſts deny speciall grace, neceſſary to converſion and ſalvation,</hi> making the common light and power given to all, ſufficient, if heeded. <hi>Papiſts give to man free-will, and a power to improve this common grace,</hi> So the Quakers. <hi>Both Papiſts, and Quakers pretend to infallibility;</hi> to <hi>a power if working Miracles;</hi> Both are alike in cenſuring, condemning, and curſing all that are not of their way. Both deny the Proteſtant Churches, to be Churches of Chriſt: both are bitter enemies to the Miniſters, and would gladly ſuppreſſe them if they could; the Popiſh Prelates in <hi>England</hi> ſought to ſilence them, and ſuppreſſe preaching, catechiſing, &amp;c. Till they were ſuppreſſed themſelves; and the raging Quakers (who roſe up in their ſteades) never ceaſed diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them and vilifying them, till they were themſelves curbed by the civil powers. The Papiſts ſought to keep people in ignorance without teaching and inſtructing them, and the Quakers ſeek to bring people from all other teachings to the light in them, that ſo they may have no other teaching then the Savage <hi>Indians</hi> have. The Papiſts and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are both alike induſtrious in compaſſing ſea and land to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, and to render them two-fold more the children of the Devil then before. I might ſhew the agreement of Papiſts and Quakers in ſeveral other particulars if it were neceſſary; doth not all this make it evident the Quakers are the Popes brats, though they be ſo unnatural they will not own their father? We have reaſon enough to believe there have been more Popiſh Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> beſides <hi>Coppinger,</hi> to inſtill theſe notions into the Quakers. This <hi>Coppinger</hi> being a Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Friar, did confeſſe to a Citizen of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (as was given in upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:164143:42"/> Oath before the Magiſtrates there) that he had ſpoken about thirty times amongſt the Quakers at <hi>London;</hi> and that he ſaw two other Franciſcan Friars at a quaking meeting, who were become chief ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers amongſt the Quakers. Now, how dreadfull a thing is it, that theſe filthy doctrines of Popery, that the people of God in the former age with ſo much deteſtation have rejected, ſhould in this apoſtatizing age with ſo much acceptance be entertained amongſt us? Sure this may be a ſufficient warning to all humble and holy Chriſtians, and to all who are not given up to believe lies, to beware of Quakeriſme, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is evidenced ſo clearly to be the common ſink of all thoſe former hereſies.</p>

               <hi>SECT. XII.</hi> The Quakers are enemies to Civility and good manners.</head>
            <p>THere is ſcarſe any Nation under the whole Heavens (even the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage <hi>Indians</hi> not excepted) but they have been taught by the light in them, to give ſome civil honour and reſpect to their ſuperiours, and to ſhew outward tokens of love and courteſie to their equals. Had therefore the Quakers minded the light within them (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do) they would not have affected ſo moroſe and clowniſh a demeanor, as to deny civility and humanity toward men: Much leſſe had they conſulted with the light of the Scriptures, where ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent precepts and examples are recorded, teaching us the ſame. It is the commendation of the holy Scriptures, that they are abſolutely ſufficient for doctrine, reproof, correction, and inſtruction in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that we may be furniſhed unto every good work; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they teach us duties of Religion and Piety towards God, ſo do they inſtruct us in duties of righteouſneſſe and civil behaviour towards men. I need not prove this charge againſt the Quakers that they are enemies againſt civility and good manners, their daily practiſe doth evidence it, they deny to give any titles of reſpect to men, though never ſo deſerving; they expreſſe no civil honour by any outward geſtures; uſe not common ſalutations, yea, they condemne ſuch as do theſe things; I ſhall therefore ſhew how contrary they walk herein to the precepts and preſidents we find in the holy Scriptures, and vindicate ſome Scriptures that they perverſly wreſt to make for them.</p>
            <p>Concerning ſaluting of men, we have Chriſts expreſſe command for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:164143:42"/> it to his diſciples <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.12. <hi>and when ye come into an houſe, ſalute it;</hi> and leſt any ſhould take this for a duty only to neere friends and acquaintance, we may ſee how Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47. teaches it to be a duty to others; <hi>Chriſtians ſhould excell others, ſhould love their enemies and ſalute them alſo, or elſe what do they more then the Publicans?</hi> Rom. 16. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpends the whole Chapter almoſt in ſalutations to the Saints, which he would not have done if it had been ſo unlawful as the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would make it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.40. we have <hi>Mary</hi> ſaluting <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> See alſo <hi>Act.</hi> 18.22. and <hi>c.</hi> 21.7, 19</p>
            <p>But that place is objected, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.4. <hi>Carry neither purſe, nor ſcrip, nor ſhooes, and ſalute no man by the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this place be compared with 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29. it will appear Chriſt intends no more, but to excite them to ſpeed and celerity in that preſent work they went about, and not to uſe ſuch ſalutations as might hinder or ſtay them in their buſineſſe, for in the next verſe, when they are come to the place where they ſhould remaine, he bids them ſalute there; Beſides, if this command ſhould be ridgidly urged to bind us now, it would make it unlawful to wear ſhooes or purſe, &amp;c. And further, how can it then be reconciled with the Scriptures before named, which do not one croſſe the other concerning our giving civil honour to men? ſee that command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. <hi>In honour preferring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the Apoſtle would not have us uncivil and barbarous, but to give due acknowledgment and teſtification to the worth and goodneſs of others, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Honour all men,</hi> Rom. 13.7. <hi>Render to all men their dues, tribute to whom tribute, honour to whom honour.</hi> So alſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and the Scriptures ſtile many perſons honourable, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.50. &amp; 17.12. ſome of them being Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and unbelievers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> But they would have theſe Scriptures to ſpeak of inward honour of the heart, not of external honour, by giving titles to them, or bowing to them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> Even theſe outward teſtifications of honour are implied there, and we have many Scriptures expreſly commending or commanding the ſame to us.</p>
            <p>For giving titles of honour to men, as calling them Lord, Maſter, Sir, Lady, &amp;c. we have many Scriptures approving thereof, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Sarah</hi> is commended by the Apoſtle for calling <hi>Abraham Lord,</hi> Gen. 16.9. The Angel calls <hi>Sarah, Agars Miſtreſſe,</hi> Matth. 10.24. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the ſervant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Lord.</hi> Theſe titles are not only to be given by ſervants to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:164143:43"/> their Maſters, but by Scholars or Diſciples to their teachers; as Chriſt ſhewes. Yea, it may be given to them by others who are not in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them; as the Prophet to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 6.5. and the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. the Apoſtle calls her to whom he writes, <hi>Lady,</hi> Acts 7.26. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the two men that ſtrove, <hi>Sirs, why do ye wrong to one another?</hi> Acts 14. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſaid to them that were ready to ſacrifice to them, <hi>Sirs, why do you thoſe things?</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, <hi>Act.</hi> 27 10, 21, 25. See <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. which title ſignifies as much as Lord or Maſter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Paul</hi> is called a Maſter-builder, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.11. Church-Officers or Teachers are called Maſters of the Aſſemblies. Beſides the title Lord or Maſter it not only uſed, but we have <hi>Epithites</hi> of further honour given to ſome perſons, as <hi>Moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Moſt Excellent, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 1.3. Acts 26.25. How vain is it then for theſe people to cavill againſt the uſe of theſe titles of honour, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures do warrant the ſame?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But againſt all theſe Scriptures they bring that one; <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Be not ye called Maſters,</hi> as if it would overthrow all theſe titles of honour. To which I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Object."/> (1.) It doth not prohibit us from giving titles of honour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though it ſhould reſtraine us from ſeeking them for our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> (2.) But it would be obſerved in what reſpect Chriſt prohibits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called Maſter there, (he forbids alſo to be called father, <hi>verſe</hi> 9.) this is ſpoken in oppoſition to that vaine affectation of ſuch titles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Phariſees, the Phariſees did covet to be Sect-Maſters, and to have abundance of Diſciples following them, upon whom they uſed to impoſe their traditions as unqueſtionable verities; and their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples uſed to call them <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or Maſter, glorying in being their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and each ſect would ſo contend for the glory of their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Captaines (for ſo the word ſignifies as well as maſter) that they would quarrel, and ſometimes kill each other in ſuch conteſts. Now theſe <hi>Rabbi's</hi> maſters, or captaines were abſolute Lords over their faith, (which is prohibited, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.) and they queſtioned nothing they received from them, even as ſuch as follow the Quakers now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all they ſpeak as unqueſtionable truths, becauſe they pretend to be infallible, and therefore they are more guilty of this crime of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Maſterſhip then any amongſt us. Who ſeeth not then how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly this Scripture is wreſted, when it is urged to oppoſe giving titles of honour to men, how they make it to contradict thoſe Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named? Whereas the ſcope of it is but to prohibit proud
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:164143:43"/> affecting of that title, and ſeeking to Lord it over mens faith.</p>
            <p>Concerning our giving civil honour and reſpect to men by outward geſtures of the body, as riſing up, or ſtanding before our ſuperiours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the head, or bowing, &amp;c. We have alſo many Scriptures to warrant theſe things. For riſing up, there is an expreſſe command, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.32. <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſo fooliſh a cavil which was once made againſt this place, by <hi>J. L.</hi> that it deſerves no confutation, when I urged this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to him, he ſaid Chriſt Jeſus was the ancient of dayes, &amp;c. was there ever more horrible perverting of Scripture then by theſe men? This is like that expoſition he gave to me lately of that place where women are forbidden to ſpeak in the Church; ſaying, it was the weaker part of man or fleſh, that was called the woman, and was to keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. We have enough of ſuch traſh from theſe men. For ſtanding up before ſuperiours, refraining ſpeech, bowing of the body, ſee <hi>Job</hi> 29.8, 9, 10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Abraham ſtood up and bowed himſelf to the people of the Land, even to the children of Heth. Jacob bowed to Eſau ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times,</hi> Gen. 33.3. <hi>Joſeph unto Jacob,</hi> Gen. 48.12. <hi>David bowed to Saul,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>My Lord the King,</hi> 1 Sam 24.8. and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet <hi>bowed</hi> to him 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.23. As for the ſingle example of <hi>Mordecai</hi> refuſing to bow to <hi>Haman</hi> (which thoſe men urge ſo ſtifly, when as all other examples nothing move them) there was a ſpecial reaſon for that; for, according to the cuſtome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the bowing there uſed, was reputed to favour of divine worſhip,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Juſtin. Hiſt. Lib.</hi> 6. Relates how <hi>Canon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> refuſed to bow to King <hi>Artaxcrxes</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> and therefore the good man could not yield to it; now as this is uſed amongſt us, its but a civil thing; Beſides, <hi>Haman</hi> probably was an <hi>Amalekite</hi> of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Agag,</hi> and ſo being of an accurſed ſeed, appointed to deſtruction; civil honour was not due to him, God had put a perpetual enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites,</hi> Deut. 25.17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>For putting off the Hat, theſe men triumph over us, and ſay, where do we finde any example in the Scriptures for that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Neither can they ſhew us in Scripture where ever hats were worne, therefore its not likely we ſhould read of putting them off; as for that place in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.21. where mention is made of the three children being caſt into the fire, with their coats, hoſen, hats; the word there tranſlated hats, ſignifies any kind of covering or garment, it coming from <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to cloath or cover, and therefore in the Margin of your books the Tranſlatours render it turbants (which were the garments worne upon their heads in thoſe Eaſterne Countreys, for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:164143:44"/> they weare no hats) but becauſe ſuch a word as that is not known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the vulgar, they retain in the text the word hats, (which we weare on our heads,) and not turbants. Secondly, though we find not in Scripture examples of putting off the hat (becauſe hats were not worne) yet we find other teſtifications of honour and reſpect given to ſuperiours, according to the cuſtome of each Countrey, as ſtanding up, bowing the knee, or the body, which are approved in Scripture, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſhewed; how ridiculous is it then to make it unlawfull to put off the hat, when thoſe other actions be approved and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?</p>
            <p>But there are ſome other Scriptures which the Quakers often urge againſt the giving or receiving honour of men, which muſt be anſwered as that, <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe which receive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one of another; and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God onely?</hi> To which I anſwer, Chriſt doth not here condemne all giving or receiving honour one of another (for in other places it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commended, as was ſhewed before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17, &amp;c.) but he forbids loving the praiſe and honour of men more then the praiſe of God, which was the ſinne of thoſe people, <hi>John</hi> 12.43. and this kept them from believing; they knew if they believed in him, they ſhould be reviled, caſt out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, and loſe the honour they had amongſt men; ſuch an honour as this we are far from pleading for, and had rather be trampled upon by men (as we have been formerly by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and now are by the Quakers) then loſe the praiſe of God; but what is this to the denying ſuch civil honour to men, as theſe Scriptures before named require?</p>
            <p>There is another place that thoſe people do much pervert, to make for them, which is, <hi>James</hi> 2.9. <hi>If ye have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſinne.</hi> To which I reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is indeed a reſpecting of perſons which is ſinfull; as when in judgement men reſpect perſons, not regarding the equity of the cauſe, but becauſe ſuch a man is rich, potent, or honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſentence is paſſed on his ſide, and the poor man oppreſſed in judgement; this is forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect perſons in judgement, but ſhalt heare the ſmall as well as the great.</hi> See alſo <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. So likewiſe out of the caſe of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there may be a ſinfull reſpecting of perſons, as when pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons ſhall highly eſteeme, love, and honour perſons that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:164143:44"/> be rich and great in the world, though vitious and ungodly, and ſhall contemne the precious Saints, when poore and low in the world, this is ſinfull reſpecting of perſons. I might adde alſo reſpecting of perſons in election to Magiſtracy, and in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters, for this is alſo ſinfull; and the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne reſpecting of perſons onely in ſome of theſe caſes here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But then there is a lawfull reſpecting of perſons, which is ſo far from being a ſinne, that it is a duty to do it; namely, when we acknowledge the dignity and excellency of others, and by ſome outward ſigne teſtifie the ſame; this was proved by thoſe precepts and examples before named, and many more might be added if it were needfull: Thus the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 3. is ſaid <hi>to regard or reſpect the preſence of Jehoſhaphat King of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> Nay, God himſelfe is ſaid to be a reſpecter of perſons, Gen. 4.4, 5. <hi>The Lord had reſpect to Abel, but unto Cain he had not reſpect;</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.21. the like is ſaid of <hi>Lot;</hi> many other places might be given, but enough is ſaid for the clearing up of this duty.</p>
            <p>Now, from all this it appeares, that as the Quakers are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from Chriſtianity, in that they deny the true Chriſt, and the (Chriſtian faith:) So they are fallen from humanity, in thus denying all good manners; and wherein can they come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bruit beaſts, then in caſting off humanity and civil demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Though they would cover over ſuch actions with the guilded ſhew of humility, yet doth it directly tend to overthrow all government and authority amongſt men; for, take away outward honour and reſpect from ſuperiours, and what government can ſubſiſt long amongſt men? Thus having ſhewed the Quakers to be ſo far degenerate, that they are no Chriſtians, nor ſcarſly men; Its time for me to put an end to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe concerning them, and to trouble my ſelf, nor the reader further with them.</p>

            <p>WE have many predictions and frequent warnings in the holy Scriptures of the hereſies and ſeductions of the laſt times; Chriſt himſelf tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.11.24. <hi>that falſe chriſts, and falſe prophets ſhall ariſe and deceive many, and if it were poſſible, they ſhould deceive the very Elect;</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Ep. 2.1. doth alſo warne, <hi>That falſe prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, and many ſhall follow their pernicious wayes, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of;</hi> and the like admonitions are given by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 1, &amp;c. as alſo by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Jude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no ground then that Chriſtians ſhould be diſcouraged at theſe over-flowing floods of errours that the Serpent now caſts out of his mouth to drown the Church; nor at the rage and violence of the enemies of the truth amongſt us; think it not ſtrange concerning theſe things, as if ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto us; the Scriptures muſt be fulfilled, that have told us before of thoſe things; and the Church of God in former times have had the ſame trials; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies muſt be, though woe to them by whom they come, or by whom they are countenanced. We may expect yet greater tryals, and ſtronger ſeducements, if no timely remedy be uſed by Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to reſtraine ſeducers from ſpreading their ſeducing doctrines. The Scriptures ſpeak of the powerful working of Satan accompanying deceivers, and a power of working (ſeeming) miracles being given to them, and of ſtrong deluſions. As the Quakers are but ſimple deceivers in compariſon of the Papiſts, and other hereticks in former ages; ſo we may fear they ſhall be much more out-vied by ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, as are yet to come in following times; when Satan is to act his laſt part in the world, it's likely he will uſe his utmoſt ſubtilty in deceiving. Our great care therefore ſhould be to preſerve our ſelves from the errours of the wicked, and to take heed of the leaven of ſuch ſeducers; how many cautions hath the Scripture given to us
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:164143:45"/> herein? when Chriſt had foretold of thoſe ſeducers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. he bids, <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you, and believe them not,</hi> this being the end of his forewarning us, that we might be forearmed againſt them; <hi>Hereſies</hi> are reckoned amongſt the <hi>fruits of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.20. and are therefore ſooner drunk in by people, then the precious truths of the Goſpel, for we cannot receive theſe without the ſpecial help of Gods Spirit to let them in to our hearts; how ſoon did the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> hereſie over-ſpread the world, only one <hi>Athanaſius</hi> viſibly withſtood it? <hi>All the world wondered after the Beaſt, and worſhipped the ſame,</hi> Rev. 13.3, 4. Popery ſoon over-ran the Weſt and North parts of the world, and Mahumetaniſme the Eaſt and South; even there where thoſe famous <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches ſometimes were ſeated, are now the impure Temples of Mahomet; no gangrene ſooner over-ſpreads the natural body, then errours and hereſies do the Eccleſiaſtick body, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. What care then ſhould Chriſtians have leſt they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſame? Adde hereunto, theſe are no leſſe deadly to the ſouls of people then gangrenes or plagues are to their bodies, ſuch doctrines eat as doth a canker or gangrene, ſaith the Apoſtle; hereſies may prove as damnable to men, as moral wickedneſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. leſſer errours indeed men may hold, and yet be ſaved, whileſt they build upon the right foundation; <hi>Though they build hay or ſtubble, thereupon they may be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire,</hi> 1 Cor. 3 13. their ſpirits may be ſcorched, their peace and comfort loſt; but to miſcarry in the foundation is damnable; who can reckon up the evil conſequences of falſe doctrines? they blind the mind, and extinguiſh the true knowledge of God; they harden the heart, they undermine the comfort of Chriſtians, and deſtroy the Churches peace, they mortally infect the inward vitals of Chriſtianity; and outwardly deprave the converſation, corrupt principles wil at length produce corrupt practiſes; they provoke the Lord to have a controverſie with a people where they are tolerated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 15, 20. and will exclude men the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. Let not any Chriſtian therefore look upon the errours and hereſies of the times as things of ſmall concernment, but make it his great care to be preſerved from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of them as men do in the time of peſtilence to be preſerved from the ſame</p>
            <p>I ſhall for the benefit of ſuch humble and ſincere Chriſtians, as fear the infection of the errours amongſt us, and are willing to uſe ſuch preſervations againſt them as the Scriptures afford; collect from thence a few antidotes of ſpecial uſe for that end, the bleſſing of the Lord accompanying them.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:164143:46"/>
            <p>Directions ſhowing, how Chriſtians may be preſerved from the errours and hrereſies of the times.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Labour to be rooted and grounded more in the truth, if you would not be ſhaken with every wind of doctrine;<note place="margin">Col. 1.23. 2 Pet. 2.14.</note> it's ungrounded and unſtable Chriſtians who commonly are ſeduced, who never ſaw on what grounds they took up their Religion, but take it on truſt from others, and then when they meet with ſuch arguments againſt the truth as they cannot anſwer, they yeild to errour, whereas that may be nevertheleſſe a truth,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.29.</note> though they cannot defend it; therefore ſearch the Scriptures more, and labour to ſee how the principles of the Chriſtian faith are eſtabliſhed upon them; and be not aſhamed to learn your Catechiſmes, wherein you have the fundamentals of Chriſtianity extracted out of the Scriptures, and plainly ſet down, even in the Primitive times they had ſuch <hi>firſt principles of the oracles of God,</hi> Heb. 5.12. and <hi>forms of wholſom words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. for the better grounding of weak Chriſtians; and the greateſt proficieo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> did firſt begin there, and therein are contained ſuch truths as may exerciſe us in ſearching further into, all our life time; <hi>Luther</hi> that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervant of Chriſt profeſſed himſelf a Scholar in the Catechiſme. Had the Quakers ever been well grounded in the firſt principles or rudiments of Religion, how is it poſſible they ſhould ſo ſoon have been turned from the truth, and denyed the doctrine of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, of the holy Trinity, of Juſtification, of Sanctification, of the reſurrection of the dead, &amp;c? for my part I know but few of them (if any) that I can judge, ever had any clear diſtinct knowledge of theſe things, and could tell how they were confirmed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let therefore weak Chriſtians (if they would not be ſeduced) uſe this direction, conſcionably give diligence to be ſetled more in the truth, and to get a clear knowledge of the great doctrines of the Goſpel; ſuch things as be fundamental and neceſſary to be known unto Salvation, are clearly ſet down in Scripture, that weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if they ſtudy them with humility, prayer and diligence, may attain the underſtanding of them; as for more difficult points, that they cannot yet comprehend, let them not too much be troubled about them, but waite till God reveale the ſame unto them; and in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time its far ſafer for them to adhere in ſuch things, to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received by the people of God, and embraced by the Saints in all ages,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.8.</note> to follow the footſteps of the flock of Chriſt, then to be led away by pretenders to new-light, the Scriptures having given ſo many Cautions to beware of ſeducers in the laſt times. This firſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:164143:46"/> direction is given by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Reſt not in a notional embracing of the truth, but receive it with love and obedience, and labour to finde your hearts bettered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and then you ſhall not ſo ſoon be induced to deſert the truth, and embrace errours; when men receive not the truth with love, they are ſoon brought to beleeve lies, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. but when men taſte the ſweetneſſe of the wayes of God, and are in love with Goſpel truths for that goodneſſe they find in them, they will hold them faſt; ſuch as have experimented the efficacy of the doctrines of faith, changing and renuing their hearts, quickning their ſpirits, pacifying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting their conſciences, and quelling their corruptions, will not be eaſily induced to exchange them for errours; but it's thoſe that never found thoſe benefits by the ſame, that ſo ſoon part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal; Let therefore the truths of Chriſt dwell in your hearts, and ſeaſon them as leaven, labour to finde your hearts molded by the ſame, and changed into the image of truth, the more you grow in grace, the more you ſhall be eſtabliſhed and kept from falling into the errour of the wicked, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. And let your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the faith appear to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19. <hi>He that doth the will of God ſhall know more thereof,</hi> John 7.17. and ſhall be eſtabliſhed therein. It is the great evil of many profeſſors in this age, they covet to fill their heads with knowledge and light, letting their hearts be empty of holineſſe and grace, they are much in ſearching after new lights, high notions and diſcoveries of ſmaller concernment; but little in working upon their ſpirits the great and ſaving truths of Chriſt, and in practiſing known Commandments; it's no wonder if ſuch prove apoſtates; <hi>they whoſe hearts are deceitful under truth, may ſoon be deceived by errour.</hi> Can we judge that theſe perſons who deny the doctrines of Chriſts humanity, of juſtification, of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp;c. ever lived in the power of theſe truths, received down the comfort of them, and had their hearts formed into holineſſe by them? if they had, they would have been hereby fortified againſt ſuch ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as tempt them to deny theſe doctrines; for my own part I muſt profeſſe, whilſt my faith is acting upon theſe great and precious truths of the Goſpel, and the comfort and ſweetneſſe of them is now flowing into my ſpirit, I cannot mention theſe filthy and abominable errours, but it is with higheſt deteſtation and abhorrence. Let this therefore
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:164143:47"/> be the care of every Chriſtian not to reſt in a bare notional knowledge, but to get a ſanctifying, experimental, and practical knowledge of the things of God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Be much in prayer that God would give you the ſpirit of Truth, and thereby guide and keep you in the truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. In times of infection you uſe not to ſtir out of your houſes, till you pray God to keep you and your families daily; had you as ſenſible apprehenſions of the infections and mortall contagion of the hereſies now raigning amongſt us, you would be as much in prayer to God for to keep you and yours daily from them; but all the admonitions in the Scripture will hardly perſwade people to believe their danger herein;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2 1. 1 Tim. 3.17.</note> are not hereſies damnable and extremely infectious and contagious as gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes and plagues, our own experiences in theſe times abundantly teſtifies it? if one perſon in a family be infected with hereſie, all the reſt ſoon learne it of them; even young ones commonly drink it in, (its more rarely ſeen that any good is ſo ſoon learnt by them) and if one houſe be infected, ſuch as live neare thereto, or converſe with them, they are alſo indangered. What need therefore to be much in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, to keep us in theſe infectious times, wherein (if it were poſſible) the very elect ſhould be deceived; we had need to commend our ſelves to him who <hi>is able to keep us from falling, Jude.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Expoſe not yourſelves to the tentations of Seducers, tis in vain to pray to God to keep you from the infection, if you wilfully, againſt the expreſſe Word of God, run into the company of Deceivers; you are bidden to <hi>avoid them,</hi> Rom. 16.17. to <hi>turn away from ſuch,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5, 6. <hi>to beware of them,</hi> Mat. 7.15. <hi>not to go after them,</hi> Luke 21.8. <hi>if they come to you, not receive them, nor bid them God-ſpeed,</hi> 2 Joh. 10. What wilful diſobedience to all theſe cleer commands is it, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will venture to go into the company and frequent the meetings of ſuch ſeducers? if Satan take ſuch among his own, how juſtly may God give them up to him as his own; this is contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the primitive Saints. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> would not ſtay in the ſame hath where <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the heretick was; nor would <hi>Policarp</hi> entertaine acquaintance with <hi>Marcion,</hi> but termed him the firſt-born of the Devil; <hi>Ireneus</hi> tells us, the Apoſtles and their Diſciples were ſo full of holy fear, that they would not communicate with them in the world, who had adulterated the Word. If you ſay we may go and hear whether they broach ſuch errors or no, what hurt in this? we muſt <hi>try all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi> I anſwer, may you not as well ſay, you will go into the peſt-houſe, and ſee whether the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:164143:47"/> perſons there be infected with the plague, before you will beware of them, how many poor and weak perſons are infected with their errours before they can diſcern what errours they hold? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. bids, <hi>prove all things, hold that faſt which is good.</hi> He intends it of the prophecyings ſpoken of in the former verſe; all things ſpoken by the Prophets in the Church, ſhould be proved by the Scriptures, whether they be ſo or no, and not received only becauſe they ſay they are of God (as the Quakers receive what their teachers deliver to them, without trying them by the Scriptures, which they deny to be the rule of faith and life) but this place makes nothing for the hearing of convicted hereticks, and open enemies to the Church. If thou beeſt therefore an humble and ſincere Chriſtian, that makeſt conſcience of the commands of the Lord, then ſhun deceivers, turn away from them, go not to their meeting, if they come to thee, <hi>receive them not into thy houſe, nor bid them God-ſpeed;</hi> but if thou wilt run upon tentations, thou haſt no promiſe of God to keep thee; it was the devils deceit to perſwade men, God will protect them out of his way, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Harbour not any ſinful luſts in your hearts, allow not of any ſecret ſin; it's ſin that makes God give up men to errour, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. becauſe <hi>they have pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> and it's ſin that makes a man like a piece of wax, ready to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of any errour; they who are not ſound in the fear of God, may eaſily become unſound in the faith of God. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19, 20. firſt put away a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> then <hi>made ſhipwrack of the faith;</hi> the women that were <hi>led captive by ſeducers,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. <hi>were ſuch as were laden with divers luſts;</hi> if the heart be corrupt and love ſinne, it will ſtrongly encline a man to entertaine corrupt, principles that will give liberty unto ſin; how ready will a wicked heart be to cloſe with the wicked errours of the Quakers, that there is no reſurrection of the fleſh, no heaven and hell, but what is now in this world; that after death nothing remains or with the Libertines opinion, that ſin is no real evil, but to him that thinks it evil; to him it is evil, (as <hi>Joſ. Salmon</hi> in his touches of good and evil ſpeaks) or with the Atheiſts opinion, that there is no God, &amp;c. look therefore to your hearts to keep them pure, if you would not be given up to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure errors; love no ſin if you would leave no truth.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Cleave more to the Miniſtry of the Word and the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers thereof, if you would not fall into errours; let not any ſay, I plead more in this for the honour and benefit of Miniſters, then for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:164143:48"/> the good of peoples ſouls,<note place="margin">So Heb. 13.7, 9.</note> for the ſpirit of God hints this direction, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 14. in <hi>v.</hi> 11. you read God hath given to his Church Prophets, Apoſtles, Paſtours, Teachers, and in the following verſes is ſhewed the end thereof, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying the Church, and perfecting the Saints, and <hi>v.</hi> 14. to prevent being toſſed to and fro, and carried away with every wind of doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſſe of deceivers. This is one great end of Gods giving Miniſters to his Church to prevent their being deceived by ſeducers; one great part of their work, is to confute gain-ſayers. There is ſcarce any deſert the truth, but they firſt deſert the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry! men firſt begin to have itching ears, and ſeek new Teachers, and then embrace lies and fables, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. how diligent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſeducers to undermine the Miniſtry, and ſteal peoples hearts from them; if the wolves can draw the ſheep from the ſhepherds, they will ſoon devour them. What deſignes have they againſt the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, maintenance, and perſons of Miniſters to bring them down, and eſpecially againſt the moſt faithful and induſtrious in the Miniſtry, think not therefore you can be long preſerved from theſe ravening wolves, if you ſtragle from your ſhepherds, but learn to keep cloſe to your faithful Miniſters. If it be asked, who are thoſe Miniſters we are to adhere unto? for many lay claime to this office now. I anſwer in two words; 1. Thoſe whom God hath ſo viſibly owned, and ſet his ſeal to by bleſſing their Miniſtry to the convincing, converting, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and confirming ſo many thouſands of his Saints in <hi>England,</hi> thoſe whom God hath uſed as inſtruments under him to maintaine the profeſſion and power of godlineſſe in the Nation for many yeares, that have by their doctrine, converſation and ſufferings adorned the Goſpel of Chriſt; can any but the hardened enemies of the truth call theſe Anti-chriſtian? whoever is not blinded by Satan, may ſee theſe to be the Miniſters of Chriſt. 2. Thoſe whom the devil and his inſtruments hath moſt oppoſed and maligned; whom the Popiſh Prelates ſilenced, fined, impriſoned, baniſhed; whom the Malignant Caveleirs hated, curſed and plundered, whom all drunkards, ſwearers; and profane perſons would have ſuppreſſed; and whom apoſtates (the moſt bitter enemies of all the reſt) do now with ſuch implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred and malignity proſecute and moleſt. Theſe are the Miniſters of Chriſt; there need no other arguments to prove it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Conſider ſeriouſly the many eminent teſtimonies God hath given from heaven againſt hereticks and apoſtates, againſt deſpiſers of his Ordinances and Miniſters, and againſt the errours and hereſies
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:164143:48"/> broached by them. God hath in all ages borne ſome ſignal teſtimony againſt them, which being duly obſerved, might be a very effectual means to preſerve from the errours of thoſe times. It might be ſhewed in what age, and by what perſons moſt of theſe (now ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed new lights, but indeed) old exploded hereſies newly revived and brought from hell, were firſt broached, what ſucceſſe they had what fearful judgements befel the Authours of them! how truth prevailed againſt them! and this might much tend to eſtabliſh Chriſtians againſt ſeducements thereunto; but this would require a volumn to do it. In the primitive times many wonderful teſtimonies God gave againſt ſeveral enemies of his truth; <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who was the firſt arch-heretick, and by his Sorceries deceived much people, and contended with the Apoſtles themſelves in working miracles (as the <hi>Egyptian Sorcerers</hi> did with <hi>Moſes</hi>) he attempting to flie in the aire, was by the prayers of the Apoſtles brought tumbling down, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably periſhed; <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was killed by the fall of an houſe; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> hanged himſelf; <hi>Manes</hi> had his skin torn off his fleſh; <hi>Arrius</hi> his bowels guſhed out; <hi>Neſtorius</hi> his tongue rotting and conſuming in his head, the earth opened and ſwallowed him up. What ſtanding monuments are theſe of Gods wrath againſt hereticks, yet are many of their wicked errours revived in theſe days, if theſe teſtimonies of Gods wrath againſt them were duly conſidered, it might make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this day more fearful of drinking in their abominable doctrines. In the firſt times of Reformation from Popery, the devil ſtirs up the Anabaptiſts to hinder that work, and they were more bitter and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant enemies to the firſt Reformers, and greater obſtructers of the work of God then the Papiſts; and what ſignal tokens of Gods wrath were ſhewen againſt them, by giving them up to ſuch vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and practiſes, as (preparing them for deſtruction) there were (ſay ſome<note n="*" place="margin">Pontanus</note>) one hundred and fifty thouſand of them ſlaine; What a warning might this be to people to beware of the leaven of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme now ſpreading amongſt us? When the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>N. England</hi> were infeſted with Antinomians, Familiſts, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinanced men (betwixt whom and the Quakers is great agreement) how did the Lord give ſignal teſtimony againſt them by thoſe prodigious births of Mrs. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Dyer?</hi> are not theſe land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to warn people to take heed of ſuffering ſhip-wrack upon ſuch rocks of errour? And amongſt our ſelves in <hi>England,</hi> God hath many ways appeared againſt the raging enemies of his truth and Miniſters, riſen up in theſe late years; ſome are ſo given up to be blinded
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:164143:49"/> and infatuated, that they have loſt the underſtanding and reaſon of men, and are become brutiſh in their wayes; others caſting off the profeſſion of godlineſſe, are given up to vile affections and practiſes; what abominable errours and deluſions have ſome ſwallowed down gredily? and what remarkable judgements of God have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len others? It would require a large volumne to record the hiſtory hereof. Theſe things, if duly conſidered, might be ſerious admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all, to take heed of deſerting the truths, Ordinances, and Miniſters of Chriſt. I adde no more, theſe directions if conſcionably uſed, might (through the bleſſing of the Lord) be ſpecial preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt the infection and contagion of the errours of our times. <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wiſe God our Saviour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 24.25.</note> 
               <hi>be Glory and Majeſty, Dominion and Power, now and ever. Amen.</hi>
